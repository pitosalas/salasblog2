Check out [this 
 post](http://opusresearch.net/wordpress/2007/01/11/iphone-lacks-conversational-aspects/) from [Opus Research](http://opusresearch.net/wordpress):

> iPhone may be a tour-de-force for the touchscreen, but it’s inexplicably 
 odd to introduce a new smartphone with so few speech-based features. I 
 can hardly express how profoundly disappointed I am that this shiny, new 
 thing – the first must-have product since Nintendo’s Wii – has less 
 voice processing than Tickle-Me Elmo.

 (from: [iPhone 
 Lacks Conversational Aspects](http://opusresearch.net/wordpress/2007/01/11/iphone-lacks-conversational-aspects/)) 

 The point of the whole essay that stuck with me is the incongruence 
 between offering a product that requires 100% visual focus and that as 
 often as not will be used while driving a car." As he says: "With 
 all the attention focused on the fancy, new screen and multi-touch 
 controls, I can only imagine what the safety implications are for in-car 
 use."
