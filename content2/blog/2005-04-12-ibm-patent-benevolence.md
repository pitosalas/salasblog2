Doc [comments with grudging admiration ](http://doc.weblogs.com/2005/04/11#someOfTheNewsThatsFitToShare)that IBM has [decided to give away](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/11/technology/11ibm.html?ex=1270872000&en=dbc95a2028b33bbe&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland)* *some parts of their much vaunted patent portfolio. One interesting tidbit is that in addition to being responsible for the most patents *granted *annually, IBM is also the leader in the most patents *allowed to expire* annually. 

Why? Because keeping all those patents current is **very costly**, and if there is no economic benefit to having those patents, thatâ€™s a lot of money down the shute.

So maybe some clever strategist/marketer (difference?) probably realized that the PR value of ***open sourcing*** these worthless patents might actually be the most valuable of all!
