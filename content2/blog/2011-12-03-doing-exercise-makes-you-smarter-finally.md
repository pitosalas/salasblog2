From the New York Times, [How Exercise Benefits the Brain:](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/how-exercise-benefits-the-brain/)

> 
“For some time, scientists have believed that BDNF helps explain why mental functioning appears to improve with exercise. However, they havenât fully understood which parts of the brain are affected or how those effects influence thinking. The Irish study suggests that the increases in BDNF prompted by exercise may play a particular role in improving memory and recall.” (**from** [NYT](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/how-exercise-benefits-the-brain/))
