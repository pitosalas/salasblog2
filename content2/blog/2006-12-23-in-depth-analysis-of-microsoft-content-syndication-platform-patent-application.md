A bit of a debate is developing regarding Microsoft’s recent patent for 
 (and here’s where the editorializing starts) "RSS". It’s only a slightly 
 interesting question which is why I won’t pursue it, save to say that 
 patents are very technical and narrow so it’s easy to jump to the wrong 
 conclusion about them when reading them only superficially. 

At any rate if there’s any beef to be had, IMHO, it’s with the Patent Law and 
 the Patent Office, not with Microsoft.

Check out [this 
 post](http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/12/microsoft-feed-platform-patent-review.html) from [Niall 
 Kennedy’s Weblog: In-depth analysis of Microsoft content syndication 
 platform patent application](http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/12/microsoft-feed-platform-patent-review.html):

 On June 21, 2005 eight Microsoft employees claimed invention rights 
 for a "content syndication platform," exemplified by Internet Explorer 
 7 and its support for aggregating feed content. Patent application 
 20060288329 pursues the "the right to exclude others from making, 
 using, offering for sale, or selling" (see United States definition of 
 a patent) normalized web feeds made available via an API and centrally 
 stored feed lists. The patent application was revealed yesterday after 
 an 18-month privacy window expired.
