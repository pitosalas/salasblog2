Curacao has in the past won or gotten very close to winning the overall Little League World Series!
So far it looks like the Curacao team has won the Caribean title. Take a look at the standings so far: [Little League World Series Standings](http://www.littleleague.org/series/2006divisions/llbb/series.htm)

Oddly enough the way the overall World Series is structured is that the US always makes it to the Semi Finals. Seems a bit rigged don’t you think? At least it’s better than the big leagues where the “World” in “World Series” means US and Canada 🙂
