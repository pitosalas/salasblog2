In my work with the [Open Source Digital Voting foundation](http://www.osdv.org), and [TrustTheVote](www.trustthevote.org), I just learned two new words, for your educational pleasure:
“[COTS” – Commercial off the shelf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_off-the-shelf)
“[COTS” – Government off the shelf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_off-the-shelf)

Ok, not all the posts here are gems, but it is also my personal memory bank 🙂
