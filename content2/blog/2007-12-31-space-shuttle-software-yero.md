Who would think that our advanced space fairing craft have a YERO (Year End Rollover) problem?
From an [article about the YERO problem:](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5026)

> “The YERO problem relates to the shuttle orbiter’s computers needing to reset through a change of year, which could cause a glitch on orbit.” (from [Nasa News](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5026))

I’ve been reading more about the pre-Shuttle space program. One factoid which is almost hard to believe was that the computers on the Apollo had the power of a modern day digital watch. I bet they didn’t have a YERO problem 🙂
