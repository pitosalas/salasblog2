excerpt: Ever heard of MPU-9250? It is a multi-chip module (MCM) which consists of
  2 dies, and houses the 3-Axis gyroscope and the 3-Axis accelerometer! Still unsure
  about how it works? Read on to find out! Hope that this article will help you understand
  the applications of MPU9250 and how to interface it with Arduino!
