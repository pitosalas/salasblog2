# Avoiding the soft delete anti-pattern

**URL:** https://www.cultured.systems/2024/04/24/Soft-delete/
**Type:** article
**Domain:** cultured.systems

**Excerpt:** The main problem with soft deletion is that youâ€™re systematically misleading the database. This is most obvious in the case of foreign key constraints.

**Notes:**
I had never thought of this. It makes sense. Interesting.
