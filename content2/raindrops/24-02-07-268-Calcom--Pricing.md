# Cal.com | Pricing

**URL:** https://cal.com/pricing
**Type:** link
**Domain:** cal.com

**Excerpt:** Open Source Scheduling: Send a link and meet or build an entire marketplace for humans to connect.

**Notes:**
This looks quite interesting. Iâ€™ve been using calendly extensively for a few years. But it is kind of expensive. Is this a viable alternative?
