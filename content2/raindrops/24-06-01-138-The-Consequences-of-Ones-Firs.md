# The Consequences of Oneâ€™s First Programming Language annotated/explained version.

**URL:** https://fermatslibrary.com/s/the-consequences-of-ones-first-programming-language#email-newsletter
**Type:** article
**Domain:** fermatslibrary.com

**Excerpt:** Fermat's Library is a platform for illuminating academic papers.

**Notes:**
Here's an interesting article, which does not really deliver on the title IMO. I am not even sure how to count the first language. For me, was it Basic (the language that got me hooked) or Pascal (the language used in college) or Assembly language (the first language I used professionally.)
