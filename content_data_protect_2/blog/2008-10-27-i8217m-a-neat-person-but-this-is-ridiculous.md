Check out this weird new practice called 5S:
> “5S is a key concept of the lean manufacturing techniques that have made makers of everything from cars to candy bars more efficient. The S’s stand for sort, straighten, shine, standardize and sustain. Lately, 5S has been moving from the plant floor to the cubicle at hundreds of offices around the country, adding desk cleaning to the growing list of demands on employees.” **from** [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122505999892670159.html)

I am so happy that I don’t have to work in such an environment!
