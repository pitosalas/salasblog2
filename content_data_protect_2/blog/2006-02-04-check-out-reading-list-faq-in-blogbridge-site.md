I just [posted](http://www.blogbridge.com/archives/2006/02/what_is_a_blogb.php) an intro to Reading Lists – publishing and subscribing – on the BlogBridge site. If you’ve wondered what the heck the fuss is about Reading Lists, [check it out](http://www.blogbridge.com/archives/2006/02/what_is_a_blogb.php). There [are even](http://www.blogbridge.com/archives/2006/01/new_screencast.php) [two short screencams](http://www.blogbridge.com/movies/bbreadinglistpub.mov) so you can actually see and hear how it all works!
