As promised here is the first of the collection of posts inspired on my recent trip. All I can say is “Utah is an amazing place.” This is one of my favorite pictures taken at Bryce. It looks otherworldly to me… If you [check out Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/98431073@N00/tags/bryce/) you can see the other pictures that I took while out there. I actually took over 400 so this was my first attempt at identifying the 100 best. Still sorting.
Anyway, as you can see from the picture, [Bryce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Canyon) is barren land, but amazing colors. Like many of the places we went to, it’s basically a desert. The geologic structures seen here and elsewhere have to do with the fact [that this section of Utah sits on the so-called Colorado plateau which was uplifted to 6-7 and -8 thousand feet at some part in the distant future](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Canyon#Creation_of_the_park). The red, by the way, is sandstone with iron content, oxidized.

As I said, Utah is awesome, check it out sometime!
