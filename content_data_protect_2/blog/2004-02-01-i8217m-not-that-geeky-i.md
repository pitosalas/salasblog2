**I’m not *that* geeky: **I am totally fascinated and entralled with what’s going on on Mars right now. I’ve followed all sorts of sources and recently came across this [blog by Susan Kitchens](http://discuss.2020hindsight.org/) who has very detailed posts about what’s going on. I don’t know who she is or how she’s connected, but it’s a pretty comprehensive way to keep up.

As a software guy I am very interested in how the software for the Rover is put together. I asked Susan whether she could give me some pointers, which [led to this recent post in her blog](http://discuss.2020hindsight.org/2004/01/31), which I thought was amusing:

*“Backing up the Mars Rover Mission: *[*Computerworld has the story*](http://www.computerworld.com/hardwaretopics/storage/story/0,10801,89629,00.html)*. They also *[*covered*](http://www.computerworld.com/governmenttopics/government/story/0,10801,88734,00.html)* the OS running the rovers, VxWorks by Wind River Systems. (I got an email asking me for more info on computing resources on MER. I’m **not *that* geeky**; I suggest you start there and research further).”*

Well, I *am* 🙂 And if I come across anything useful, I will pass it on. In the meanwhile here are some other links that I follow for Mars news: [Steve Squires, the “principal investigator” of the mission actually has a blog.](http://athena.cornell.edu/news/) And of course [Nasa/JPL has a web site of their own](http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html) with news and some amazing animations.
