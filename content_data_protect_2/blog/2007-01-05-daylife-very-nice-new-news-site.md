Notwithstanding the fact that Mike Arrington, an investor, doesn’t like [DayLife](http://www.daylife.com/topstories) too much, I just spend a few minutes looking, and I think it’s very very nice.
I’d say it’s definitely worth a look. 

The other investors seem to like it better. Ironic state of affairs, aint it? Unless it’s a totally subversive way for Mike Arrington to get attention to the site. Wouldn’t that take the cake?
