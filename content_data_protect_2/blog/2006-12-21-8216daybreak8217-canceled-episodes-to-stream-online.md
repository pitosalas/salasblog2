This is too bad. Daybreak was one of the new shows I was enjoying (not ‘must-see-tv but still entertaining.) It was basically “Groundhog Day meets ’24’. Anyway, check out [this 
 post](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LostRemote/~3/64461720/) from [Lost Remote](http://www.lostremote.com):

> The new ABC show Daybreak is getting the ax. The terrific, 24-like show 
 is a tough one to join mid-season, so ratings slipped and ABC did what 
 networks do. My fiancee is a huge fan of the show, and fortunately the 
 remaining episodes will be streamed online — a programming move that’s 
 quickly becoming the standard.
