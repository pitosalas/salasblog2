Ok, that’s my own curious headline for this interesting article in the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/15/magazine/15FOB-medium-t.html):
> “What, after all, is a more recognizable symbol of the capriciousness of life than a deck of cards, out of which your fate is randomly dealt? And yet here the deck icon is only superficial. At heart it’s not a random-card generator but the opposite: a highly wrought program with a memory, an algorithm and a mandate to keep children in the game. *An app posing as a spatiotemporal object*.” (**from** [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/15/magazine/15FOB-medium-t.html))
