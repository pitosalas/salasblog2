One more in the category of ‘you can find everything on the internet’ check out this [“falling woman”](http://xoxma.com.ua/img/flash/00001.swf) flash animation. Watch the woman fall. When she stops falling, use your mouse to drag her to another place, and away she goes. (No it’s not as creepy as that description makes it sound)!
