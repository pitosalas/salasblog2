This new site looks quite cool. It’s a friendlier alternative to eVite, 
 less ad heavy and more fun. They just launched today! Check out [this 
 post](http://mypunchbowl.wordpress.com/2007/01/15/mypunchbowlcom-now-live/) from [MyPunchblog](http://mypunchbowl.wordpress.com):

 It’s been a blast developing this new product — we hope you’ll [sign 
 up](http://www.mypunchbowl.com) and give it a try.
