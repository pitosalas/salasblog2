As you know from a previous post, I’ve been working on a “domain specific language” for election ballot processing. In my search for information I got a pointer to a book called: [Ruby Best Practices](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596523009?ie=UTF8&tag=blogbridge-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596523009)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=blogbridge-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596523009). It’s not out yet, but it looks like it will be excellent.
You can [get a sample chapter (which contained lots of information relevant to my domain specific language work) here.](http://cachefly.oreilly.com/catalogs/Mastering_the_Dynamic_Toolkit.pdf)

In it you will “[… snip] look at a **favorite topic for budding Rubyists.** I’m going to share the secrets behind building flexible interfaces that can be used for **domain-specific applications**.”. Hmm. Does that make me a budding Rubyist? I thought I had already budded 🙂

Anyway, I really got a lot out of the sample chapter and look forward to when the book is out.
