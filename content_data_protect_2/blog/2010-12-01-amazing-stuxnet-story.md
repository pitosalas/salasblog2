With apologies for quoting a [Foxnews](http://www.foxnews.com) story, and with thanks to [Scott Adams](http://dilbert.com/blog/) for the link, here’s a fascinating behind the scenes story of Stuxnet:
> “The mission: Infiltrate the highly advanced, securely guarded enemy headquarters where scientists in the clutches of an evil master are secretly building a weapon that can destroy the world. Then render that weapon harmless and escape undetected.” (**from** [Mystery Surrounds Cyber Missile That Crippled Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Ambitions](http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/11/26/secret-agent-crippled-irans-nuclear-ambitions/))

and how well did it work?

> ““We brought it into our lab to study it and even with precautions it spread everywhere at incredible speed,” Byres said.” (**from** [Mystery Surrounds Cyber Missile That Crippled Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Ambitions](http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/11/26/secret-agent-crippled-irans-nuclear-ambitions/))

Read the whole thing, it’s fascinating! [Mystery Surrounds Cyber Missile That Crippled Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Ambitions](http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/11/26/secret-agent-crippled-irans-nuclear-ambitions/)
