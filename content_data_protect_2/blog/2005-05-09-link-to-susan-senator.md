[Susan Senator](http://susansenator.com/) has published a book: “Making Peace with Autism”:

> “It’s her memoir about our family, and how we have dealt with the autism that afflicts our oldest son”

(Susan is [Ned Batchelder’s](http://www.nedbatchelder.com/blog/) wife.)

Check it out, and also check out the web site (probably written with Python 🙂 that Ned built for Susan.

A book that I read recently about what it might be like to be autistic is [“The Curious Incident of the Doc in the Night-Time”](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400032717/foxwritings/102-1977025-6628123), or the book with the upside down dog on the cover.

I thought it was an excellent book whether or not you are interested in autism. It’s an engaging and quick read. And if you don’t know anything about it, you are sure to get some new perspective.
