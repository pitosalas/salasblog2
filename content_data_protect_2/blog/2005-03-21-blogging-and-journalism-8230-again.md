If you are a blog aficionado then you’ve followed this debate, ad *something*.
I don’t have any pearls of wisdom to add, but did [come across this quite good article](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/03/08/BLOGGERS.TMP) discussing the issues (via [MacNetJournal](http://www.whiterabbits.com/MacNetJournal/March2005.html#note_3088))

> “Or in Walsh’s words, in trying to tell if a blog is serious journalism or the rant of a pajama-clad windbag, “It’s kind of like art. You know it when you see it.”

Hmm. I thought that was pornography 🙂
