excerpt: Implementing a GPT model from scratch in NumPy. This is a detailed article
  including python  source code. Ive skimmed it and it does explain a lot. But even
  without my being a neural net, ai, machine learning, gpt, chatgpt expert, i think
  i would learn a lot. Also the article is very well written presented.
