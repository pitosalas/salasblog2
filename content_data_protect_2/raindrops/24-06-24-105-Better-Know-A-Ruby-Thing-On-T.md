# Better Know A Ruby Thing: On The Use of Private Methods â€“ Noel Rappin Writes Here

**URL:** https://noelrappin.com/blog/2024/06/better-know-access-control-part-2/
**Type:** article
**Domain:** noelrappin.com

**Excerpt:** Ruby: Make all methods public

**Notes:**
The attached article takes a fairly contrarian view, basically advocating that all ruby methods should be public unless they have side effects. I can't say I agree with this, but his analysis is a good read and has some good insights.
