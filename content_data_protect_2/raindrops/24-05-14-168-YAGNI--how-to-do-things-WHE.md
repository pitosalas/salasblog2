**URL:** https://codibly.com/news-insights/yagni-how-to-do-things-when-you-actually-need-them-to-be-done/
**Type:** article
**Domain:** codibly.com

**Excerpt:** YAGNI – how to do things WHEN you actually need them to be done

**Notes:**
Not everyone thinks YAGNI is a good principle. I happen to very much think it is. Of course rules can always be broken if you know what you're doing!
