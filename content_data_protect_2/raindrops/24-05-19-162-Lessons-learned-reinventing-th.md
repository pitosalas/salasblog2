# Lessons learned reinventing the Python notebook

**URL:** https://marimo.io/blog/lessons-learned
**Type:** article
**Domain:** marimo.io

**Excerpt:** Designing a notebook that can be shared as an app, run as a script, versioned with git, and more

**Notes:**
I have not tried this yet, but reading this summary – – which is quite comprehensive – – tell me that the authors have really understood something important about Jupiter notebooks and her trying something that could be a whole lot more valuable. When I use Jupiter notebooks. I always get points when the code is getting too complicated or two and I end up moving it to VS code to work on it a software engineering kind of mode.
