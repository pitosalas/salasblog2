excerpt: In these series of tutorials I will explain new java concepts of an intermediate
  level (threads, AWT, Swing, etc.) and basic concepts for game programming (game
  loop, FPS, sprite, etc). These tutorials are useful both for those who want to program
  games, as for those who, with a basic or intermediate level in java, want to learn
  and improve java programming concepts in an entertaining way.
