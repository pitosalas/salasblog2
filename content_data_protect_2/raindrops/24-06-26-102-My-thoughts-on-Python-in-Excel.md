# My thoughts on Python in Excel

**URL:** https://www.xlwings.org/blog/my-thoughts-on-python-in-excel
**Type:** article
**Domain:** xlwings.org

**Excerpt:** An in-depth review of Microsoft's new Python in Excel functionality

**Notes:**
The attached article severely dings the “python in excel” feature that was announced to great fanfare about a year ago. For me the headline is that Python in Excel is NOT a replacement for VBA. Rather it’s better to think of it as a replacement for the excel formula language.
