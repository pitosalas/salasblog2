# How HEAD works in git

**URL:** https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/03/08/how-head-works-in-git/
**Type:** link
**Domain:** jvns.ca

**Excerpt:** Usually when people say that a topic is confusing when I think it’s not, the reason is that there’s actually some hidden complexity that I wasn’t considering. And after some follow up conversations, it turned out that HEAD actually was a bit more complicated than I’d appreciated!

**Notes:**
Julia Evans continues with her tour the force in depth explainers about how git actually works.
