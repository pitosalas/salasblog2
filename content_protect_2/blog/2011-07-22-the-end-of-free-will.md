Check out [The End of Free Will](http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/the_end_of_free_will/)(**from** [Dilbert.com Blog](http://dilbert.com/blog/entry.feed/):
** "First we need to define free will. In the past, I’ve defined it as the brain’s magical ability to make decisions independent of the physical laws of the universe. And since I don’t believe in magic, or souls, I conclude that free will doesn’t exist, at least by that limited definition. In my view, we’re just moist robots bumping around and imagining we have control." (from: **[The End of Free Will) ](http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/the_end_of_free_will/)
