Continuing my series about my recent trip through 5 National Parks, here’s [Capitol Reef](http://www.nps.gov/care). This is a little known **National Park** in Utah. 

Interesting cocktail party tidbit (if what the [rangers](http://www.princetonreview.com/cte/profiles/dayInLife.asp?careerID=107) tell us can be believed): in the “old days” the explorers, trappers, and homesteaders tended to use nautical metaphors for land masses, and when they encountered a geographic feature which blocked their passage, stopped their progress, they would refer to it as a “reef.”  So Capitol **Reef** is a [fold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterpocket_Fold) in the landscape of the [Colorado Plateau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_plateau) which was almost impassable.

Why “Capitol”? Because of the numerous rounded (erosion) white (sandstone) mountains which reminded the explorers of the Capitol in Washington DC. (If the [rangers](http://www.princetonreview.com/cte/profiles/dayInLife.asp?careerID=107) can be believed) 

We stayed at the [Sky Ridge Bed and Breakfast Inn](http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=bed+and+breakfast&near=Torrey,+UT+84775&radius=0.0&latlng=38298889,-111418333,725158111843378999&sa=X&oi=local&ct=result&cd=1) and it was sensational. If you happen to be going through [Torrey Utah](http://www.torreyutah.com/), I would highly recommend it!
