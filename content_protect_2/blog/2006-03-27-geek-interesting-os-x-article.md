Ever wonder how Mac’s OS X program launch and execution works? No? Hmm. 

Anyway, [here’s a fascinating](http://0xfe.blogspot.com/2006/03/how-os-x-executes-applications.html) article telling you more than you ever thought you wanted to know!

> “As you can see, executing a process in OS X is a complex affair, and I have tried to cover as much as is necessary for a useful debugging session.” (**from** “[How OS X Executes Applications”](http://0xfe.blogspot.com/2006/03/how-os-x-executes-applications.html))
