An interesting article in the [New York Times Magazine today about ‘Strictly Platonic Relationships](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25FOB-Medium-t.html)‘, according to Craigs’ List denizens:
> ‘And while they stress their lofty indifferences, the members of the Strictly Platonic crowd are equally passionate about their desire: conversation, conversation, conversation. Live, e-mail, phone, text, chat — platonic people, it seems, want people to talk to.’
