[Amyloo](http://blogs.opml.org/amyloo/) has an [interesting post](http://blogs.opml.org/amyloo/2006/02/04#churningUrnsOfBurningFunk) about reading lists. One thing **bears expanding** on:

> “There’s a tendency to think of reading lists as topic-oriented and fairly static — refined and appended to, but keeping most of the same data over time. A slant on reading lists I’ve thought about are specialized lists that change their composition entirely on a periodic basis, a list in which none of the feeds you see today may be there next week.” (**from** [Churning urns of burning funk](http://blogs.opml.org/amyloo/2006/02/04#churningUrnsOfBurningFunk))

**True**. And actually there are a lot of very interesting sources for reading lists which are not human experts but still make very interesting reading. 

For example, you can get [Feedster’s Top 100](http://top500.feedster.com/) Blogs as a [Reading List](http://top500.feedster.com/top500.php?type=opml).  The result using this hyperlink as a Reading List is a dynamic set of feeds, the Feedster 100, which is automatically changed whenever Feedster resorts their Top100.

Almost more interesting, you can use Gada.be to compute  a dynamic Reading List which is the result of a search query. So for example, interactively, here is Gada.be’s search result for Chris Pirillo. And here is the same thing as a [Reading List.](http://gada.be/d/chrispirillo/opml) The result of using this hyperlink as a Reading List is a set of feeds corresponding to the result of the search in a whole series of search engines.

[Try both examples in BlogBridge](http://www.blogbridge.com/archives/2006/02/how_do_i_subscr.php) to see. Makes your **head spin** doesn’t it? (At least it does mine 🙂
