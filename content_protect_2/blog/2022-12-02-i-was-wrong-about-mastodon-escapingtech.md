[ I Was Wrong About Mastodon – EscapingTech]( https://escapingtech.com/tech/opinions/i-was-wrong-about-mastodon-moderation.html) –Excellent article explaining mastodon logic and semantixs, especially with respect to the relationship that instances have to each other and what moderation options instance operstors have. The author: “I said that Mastodon moderation wouldn’t scale, it does. The cultural differences will likely continue to maintain a friendlier atmosphere regardless of size.”
