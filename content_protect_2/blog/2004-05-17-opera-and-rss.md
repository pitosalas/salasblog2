[Various people ](http://channels.lockergnome.com/rss/archives/software/010330.phtml)are [saying that Opera](http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2004-05-14-opera-rss_x.htm), with it’s new release, is the first email client to integrate RSS access. Not true. [Oddpost](http://www.oddpost.com/), a very nice and unique web-based mail client has had this for a while. **I recommend it.**
