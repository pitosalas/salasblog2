A seminal article about an [advanced topic in software testing: Mocks aren’t Subs](http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html)

> “The term ‘Mock Objects’ has become a popular one to describe special case objects that mimic real objects for testing. Most language environments now have frameworks that make it easy to create mock objects. What’s often not realized, however, is that mock objects are but one form of special case test object, one that enables a different style of testing. In this article I’ll explain how mock objects work, how they encourage testing based on behavior verification, and how the community around them uses them to develop a different style of testing.” (**from** [Mocks aren’t Subs by Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html))
