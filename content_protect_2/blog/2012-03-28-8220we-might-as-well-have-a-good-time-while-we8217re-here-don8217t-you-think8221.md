This is from a play we saw last year at the [Huntington Theatre.](http://www.huntingtontheatre.org) The play is [Prelude to a Kiss by Craig Lucas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_to_a_Kiss_(play)). It [production was quite good but](http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/0910/prelude/multimedia.aspx) this particular speech struck me as the  best part of the play. Don’t read it as depressing just as really good writing and really true.
