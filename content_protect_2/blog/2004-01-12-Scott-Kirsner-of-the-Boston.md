**[Scott Kirsner of the Boston Globe:](http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2004/01/12/tech_negativity_bubble_begins_to_deflate/) “**Salas has spent the past few months developing **BlogBridge**, software that allows users to easily keep tabs on multiple weblogs — kind of a “Reader’s Digest” for the blog world.” Thanks for the mention, Scott. The whole bit is:

**
*Pito Salas** was the chief technology officer at **eRoom**, an online collaboration company acquired last year by **Documentum**, which in turn was bought by **EMC**. Salas has spent the past few months developing **BlogBridge**, software that allows users to easily keep tabs on multiple weblogs — kind of a “Reader’s Digest” for the blog world. (You can try out an early version at www.blogbridge.com.)*

*But now it seems like Salas, a onetime Lotus exec, has put the project on hold temporarily, and is turning his energies to consulting.*

This is accurate, but with a strong emphasis on the word **TEMPORARILY. **

I am looking into ways to add resources to the BlogBridge project. I continue to feel strongly about the underlying ideas. In fact with every week that goes by, things get more interesting. Please contact me if you want to talk or get involved.

By the way, you can find more information about BlogBridge at [http://www.blogbridge.com](http://www.blogbridge.com).
