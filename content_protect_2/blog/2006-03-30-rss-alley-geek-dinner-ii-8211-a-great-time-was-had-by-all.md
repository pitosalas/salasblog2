Last night’s event was a **lot of fun**. A ton of energy in the room, people huddling around comparing notes, even doing some demos. The place was nice and loud (good) and packed (also good!)

**Thanks** again to the co-organizers, [Bela Labovitch](http://blogs.opml.org/BelaLabovitch), [Adam Green](http://www.darwinianweb.com/). Also to the folks at [Top Ten Sources](http://www.toptensources.com/toptensources/home.aspx) and RSS Labs for sharing their wonderful space with us.

If you **missed** this one, **don’t fret**. We’ll be organizing the next one soon, somewhere around the beginning of June.
