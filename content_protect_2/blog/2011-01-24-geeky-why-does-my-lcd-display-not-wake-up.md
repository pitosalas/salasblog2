When my computer turns on it can often take 30 to 120 seconds for my Samsung LCD display to wake up. Facts of the case:

- Display is 213T and is something like 3-5 years old

- Office can be cold

- I am sure the computer is ready within seconds. Itâ€™s just waking up. It will play music for example right away.

- In every other respect the display is fine

- It has always done this
