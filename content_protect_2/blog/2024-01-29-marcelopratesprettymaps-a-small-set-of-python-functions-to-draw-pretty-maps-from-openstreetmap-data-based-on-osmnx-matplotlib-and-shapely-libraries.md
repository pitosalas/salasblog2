Open Streetmaps is one of the nicest packages for maps. But using it is really messy. [Prettymaps](https://github.com/marceloprates/prettymaps) is a package that makes it easy to use OpenStreetMaps, in python. It contains a small set of Python functions to draw pretty maps from OpenStreetMap data. Based on osmnx, matplotlib and shapely libraries.
