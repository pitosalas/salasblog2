We are **looking for a few people **who would be willing to give verbal feedback on BlogBridge usability. I think it would take at most 1/2 hour of your time, and youâ€™d have a chance to have a very direct impact on the direction of the product. Please call Pito or email me at pitoatblogbridge.com and I will fill you in. 
When we have **T-Shirts**, you will get one, **gratis**!
