**Forced to use Atom. **Well, it’s happening… My friend [Paul English](http://www.paulenglish.com/) has been using Blogger for the longest time for his personal blog. I often complained to him that I used a Blog Reader (FeedDemon is my current favorite, until BlogBridge comes out 🙂 and wouldn’t be able to follow his blog until he had a feed…

Well as you may know, [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) now has a feed, and it’s uses the Atom format. In the **‘tempest in a teapot’** department, you might have followed the Atom/RSS battle, which took an interesting turn when Blogger (=Google) decided to support *only* Atom as their format. Clever strategic move or **small minded vindictiveness**?

So, Paul’s blog is the first time that I have been **forced to use Atom**. Luckily the latest Beta of **FeedDemon *does *support Atom** and so I can read Paul’s blog right along all my other favorites.

This is just another in the continuing format, API, or protocol conflicts which arise constantly in the our business. It’s a **good kind of conflict** because it raises important issues and allows things to evolve to a better place. 

Remember VIM and MAPI? That battle **shook the very foundations** of the software industry at the time. (VIM stood for “Vendor Independent Messaging” but the running joke was that it really stood for “Vendors Ignoring Microsoft”, led by Lotus. Remember Lotus 😉 And more recently, how about **SHTTP vs. HTTPS**? HTTPS eventually became SSL which of course is all anyone remembers.

My point is that as our products and visions and customers and platforms move forward, there is a **constant tension between evolution and compatibility**. It’s clear that this is a good thing in the end, although a whole lot of glass is broken along the way. The one thing I know for sure is that it’s **way too early to stop the evolution right now**.
