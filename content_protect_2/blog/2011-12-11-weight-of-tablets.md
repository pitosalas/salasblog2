I’ve been playing around with each of the major tablets while considering ‘my next move’ 🙂

Oddly I have not been able to find a side by side comparison of their weights. After googling for 3 minutes. So as a public service let me transcribe my notes on this vital topic.

- Apple iPad 2: 21.1 oz
- Barnes and Nobel Nook Color: 15.8 oz
- Amazon Kindle Fire: 14.6 oz
- Barnes and Nobel Nook Tablet: 14.1 oz
- Amazon Kindle Touch: 7.8 oz
- Amazon Kindle 4: 5.9 oz
