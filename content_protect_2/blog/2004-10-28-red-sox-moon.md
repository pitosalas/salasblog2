In honor of the **Red Sox**, the moon will turn red tonight. It will start melting into the dark sky around 9.15. Between 10.23 and 11.44, it will be some shade of red, like **Curt Schillingâ€™s sock**. 
After that, with the Red Sox hopefully having achieved their mission, the moon will regain its composure and return to light up the sky, just as these players have lightened up our Fall. 

Take a look: about due South, about 45 degrees up.
