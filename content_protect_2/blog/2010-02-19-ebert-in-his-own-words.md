A [beautifully written comment (positive) by Roger Ebert](http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/02/roger_eberts_last_words_cont.html) on the [article about him in Esquire that I mentioned the other day:](/2010/02/17/roger-ebert-essential/)
**“Well, we’re all dying in increments. I don’t mind people knowing what I look like, but I don’t want them thinking I’m dying. To be fair, Chris Jones never said I was. If he took a certain elegiac tone, you know what? I might have, too. And if he structured his elements into a story arc, that’s just good writing. […] I knew exactly what he started with, and I could see where he ended, and he can be proud of the piece.” (from** [Roger Ebert’s Journal](http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/02/roger_eberts_last_words_cont.html))
