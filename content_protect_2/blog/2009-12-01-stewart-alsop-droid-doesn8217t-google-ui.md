This is an [insider’s three-fer](http://alsop-louie.com/gadgets/droid-doesnt-its-not-ready-for-prime-time/). In this article, Stewart describes his [horrible personal experience](http://alsop-louie.com/gadgets/droid-doesnt-its-not-ready-for-prime-time/) with the Verizon Droid. It’s a fun read. Three angles:
(1) It’s been years and years since I’ve seen Stewart Alsop [publishing a product review](http://alsop-louie.com/gadgets/droid-doesnt-its-not-ready-for-prime-time/). Stewart, years ago, was totally famous in the tech world as software taste maker par-excellence. Kind of like [Walt Mossberg](http://ptech.allthingsd.com/) is today (whoops – you don’t know who Mossberg is?) 

(2) All I’ve seen lately is [hero worship of Google Android](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_47/b4156028709435.htm?campaign_id=rss_topStories) (cell phone software) and by extension, the new Verizon Droid. Here’s a review from Stewart that knocks down, slaps around, and buries the Droid. Wow! Welcome **back** Stewart, or haven’t I been looking in the right place? From the old days, I am sure you [remember getting responses like this one 🙂](http://www.technovia.co.uk/2009/11/stewart-alsop-says-dumb-things-get-attention.html) By the way, here’s what [Mossberg thought of Droid.](http://ptech.allthingsd.com/20091104/motorolas-droid-is-smart-success-for-verizon-users/)

(3) I’ve been meaning to call out Google’s terrible user interfaces for a while now. And I am not talking (just) about the [totally inscrutable Wave](https://wave.google.com/wave/?pli=1) (also subject of excessive hero worship, but in fairness, it’s still pre-beta) but good old stalwarts as GMail (great product with lots of UI suckitude, even though I use it every day) and even the good old www.google.com. I mean look at [Bing](http://www.bing.com). Simple and straightforward, and still elegant and easy on the eye. And fast loading. Even the top-secret ‘redesign’ or ‘update’ of the www.google.com search page looks amateurish with ugly icons and ugly colors.

Ok, that’s my insider’s three-fer. Each one could be expanded into it’s own post, and, maybe I will!
