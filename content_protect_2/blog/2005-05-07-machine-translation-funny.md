The highly anticipated Mac OS X “Tiger” arrived in my hot little hands, and I’ve spent most of the day installing it (2 hours) and getting everything to work again (6 hours and counting.) 

One of the highly touted new features is “Dashboard” which is a “not quite as good as” **knock-off** of [Konfabulator](http://www.konfabulator.com/). 

One of the widgets is a ‘translation widget” to translate from one language to another. I’ve no idea whether the translation is on board or being outsourced to a web site.

It works pretty well, but you can have **fun** with it, by translating the same phrase back and forth.

> “Why are you looking at me?” 

“¿por qué usted me está mirando?”

“why you are watching to me?”

“¿por qué usted está el mirar a mí?”

“why you are to watch at me?”

“¿por qué usted está el reloj en mí?”

“why you are the clock in me?”

“¿por qué usted está el reloj en mí?” 

At which point it stabilized asking me about the clock in me. 

Ok, so some of those hours were **spent playing around**!
