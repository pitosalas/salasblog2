I came [across a cool series of podcasts](http://www.adamgreen.org/), done by **Adam Green**, on the history of the personal computer software industry. Actually Adam told me about them üôÇ You can find them [here](http://www.adamgreen.org/) as well as directly under the [iTunes podcast section](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=97303498&s=143441).

I just listened to the first episode, about software naming with some good stories about how [Visicalc](http://www.bricklin.com/visicalc.htm) was named and the fact that [Ashton-Tate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton-Tate) was not named after a parrot called Ashton, and of course that [Jeff Tarter](https://sf1000.registeredsite.com/~user989239/workshop.html) is **not **retired. 

*p.s. Adam has a really **[interesting blog called ‚ÄúDarwinian Web‚Äù ](http://darwinianweb.com/)**Also follow his **[escapades with Ruby](http://ruby.darwinianweb.com/)*
