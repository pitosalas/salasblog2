# Deckset for Mac: Presentations from Markdown in No Time

**URL:** https://www.deckset.com/
**Type:** link
**Domain:** deckset.com

**Excerpt:** Write down your thoughts in your favourite text editor, and Deckset will turn them into beautiful presentations.

**Notes:**
I was looking for a nice package to create slides using markdown files. This one is very nice except it cannot export to straight html/css/js. But other than that, I do recommend it!
