# The Hidden Power of Symbols in Ruby: When to Use Symbols Instead of Strings - Thnk And Grow

**URL:** https://blog.thnkandgrow.com/the-hidden-power-of-symbols-in-ruby-when-to-use-symbols-instead-of-strings/
**Type:** article
**Domain:** blog.thnkandgrow.com

**Excerpt:** What are symbols in Ruby and why are they?

**Notes:**
The linked article talks about strings and symbols in Ruby. When I teach software engineering with Ruby I often struggle to really explain symbols, why they exist and how to use them. While they are cool for certain very specific purposes, I think if we were going to try to make the language smaller, I would suggest removing that feature!
