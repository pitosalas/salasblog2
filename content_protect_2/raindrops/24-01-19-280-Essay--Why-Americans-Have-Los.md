# Essay | Why Americans Have Lost Faith in the Value of College

**Excerpt:** Three generations of ‘college for all’ in the U.S. has left most families looking for alternatives.

**Notes:**
"One result of this transactional attitude has been a sharp increase in cheating. College is one of the few products whose consumers try to get as little out of it as possible, because its market value is tied to the credential, not to the education that it is meant to represent, says Bryan Caplan, an economist at George Mason University and author of “The Case Against Education.”"
