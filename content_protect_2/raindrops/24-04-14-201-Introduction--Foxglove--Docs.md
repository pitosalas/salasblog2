# Introduction | Foxglove | Docs

**URL:** https://docs.foxglove.dev/docs/introduction
**Type:** link
**Domain:** docs.foxglove.dev

**Excerpt:** Foxglove helps teams explore, collaborate on, and ultimately make sense of their data more efficiently.

**Notes:**
I have seen this demoed. Haven't tried it yet, but it looks great. In summary (I think) it is an RVIZ++ but that runs in a web browser. So, you can for example access it from an iPad or a non-Linux computer. Looks very useful.
