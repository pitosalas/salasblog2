excerpt: A great solution to a very specific problem I have been having! --> As you
  may have noticed, by default you do not have access to the GPIO-pins, the SPI-bus
  or the I2C-bus as a normal user and you have to use 'sudo' to access them or run
  an application that utilizes them; it is generally a good idea to limit access to
  such things for security, but on a dev-board like the UP and UP^2 it may be convenient
  to do development and testing as a regular user.
