# How I use Claude Code | Christian B. B. Houmann

**URL:** https://bagerbach.com/blog/how-i-use-claude-code
**Type:** article
**Domain:** bagerbach.com

**Excerpt:** I run multiple Claude Code instances daily for everything from throwaway scripts to production systems. This guide covers the patterns, commands, and workflow optimizations I've developed - including how to use CC effectively with existing codebases, manage parallel agents, and avoid common pitfalls.

**Notes:**
Linked is a good article about using Claude code in sophisticated ways. I am a big big fan of Claude code.
