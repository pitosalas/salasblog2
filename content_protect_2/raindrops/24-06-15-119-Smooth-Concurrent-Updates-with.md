# Smooth Concurrent Updates with Hotwire Stimulus - Blog - Visuality

**URL:** https://www.visuality.pl/posts/smooth-concurrent-updates-with-hotwire-stimulus
**Type:** article
**Domain:** visuality.pl

**Excerpt:** It's time to get familiar with another part of Hotwire: Stimulus! In this article, I'll demonstrate using Stimulus to handle more complex frontend logic.

**Notes:**
I admit I get confused by the various packages in this family of related low or no JavaScript goodies released by DHH. Hotwire, Stimulus, Hotwire Stimulus (something different, I guess). Some come with rails, some compete with each other. No matter, I love them all. I love the idea of not having to write and debug JavaScript. Hereâ€™s an article with code that shows a great use case.
