# Pepper the humanoid and programmable robot |Aldebaran

**URL:** https://www.aldebaran.com/en/pepper
**Type:** link
**Domain:** aldebaran.com

**Excerpt:** Discover Pepper the humanoid robot designed to interact with humans. Standing 120cm tall, Pepper can perceive his environment and speak 15 languages.

**Notes:**
A robot used in research. This one is a whole body with arms and legs. One comment I heard is that device is a little noisy with motors and audio quality is not great. Also, check out the price!
