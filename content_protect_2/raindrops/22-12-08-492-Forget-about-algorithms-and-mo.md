**URL:** https://thenextweb.com/news/forget-about-algorithms-and-models-learn-how-to-solve-problems-first
**Type:** article
**Domain:** thenextweb.com

**Excerpt:** An interesting article, stating the obvious. This is highly relevant to someone who teaches college students their in their very first year of learning programming. And yet it is still a subject of debate among my colleagues. Heres the authors’s own words: “t's not necessarily about what programming language you learn or use. It's about how you approach problem solving.”
