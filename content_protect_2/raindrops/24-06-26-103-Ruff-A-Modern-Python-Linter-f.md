# Ruff: A Modern Python Linter for Error-Free and Maintainable Code – Real Python

**URL:** https://realpython.com/ruff-python/
**Type:** link
**Domain:** realpython.com

**Excerpt:** Ruff is an extremely fast, modern linter with a simple interface, making it straightforward to use. It also aims to be a drop-in replacement for other linting and formatting tools, like Pylint, isort, and Black. It's no surprise it's quickly becoming one of the most popular Python linters.

**Notes:**
The linked article goes in depth about ruff. Everyone loves ruff. Ruff is written in rust. Everyone loves rust. I think that last part is weird. Rust is a cool and interesting language but it is also pretty low level. Sure, for the user, rust programs tend to be very fast. But for the programmer, it’s more work and harder than… pick your language - python, ruby, java, swift… I mean why aren’t we all asking for programs written in c or assembly even? Anyway, I digress.
