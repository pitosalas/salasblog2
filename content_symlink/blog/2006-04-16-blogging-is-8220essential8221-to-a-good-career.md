Boy, blogs sure are **hot**, aren’t they? I’ve been noticing the New York Times regularly quoting bloggers as legitimate sources side by side with witnesses, experts, politicians. And now the [Boston Globe has a bit](http://bostonworks.boston.com/news/articles/2006/04/16/blogs_essential_to_a_good_career/) about blogging your way to a job:

> “Blogging is good for your career. A well-executed blog sets you apart as an expert in your field.” 

[…] But pick your topics carefully and have a purpose. ”The most interesting blogs are focused and have a certain attitude,” says van Allen. ”You need to have a guiding philosophy that you stick to. You cannot one minute pontificate on large issues of the world and the next minute be like, ‘My dog died.’ ” 

[…] Day realized the value of focus after a misguided mashup of his politics and business. (**from** [The Boston Globe](http://bostonworks.boston.com/news/articles/2006/04/16/blogs_essential_to_a_good_career/)) 

Of course the blog that you are reading right now is just such a mashup of random topics that interest me. That’s probably why my **experimentation** with putting ads so far **has yielded next to nothing**. But I am experimenting as much to learn how ads on web pages do and don’t work as much as anything.
