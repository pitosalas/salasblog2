If you haven’t seen this, it’s kind of cool. [Zillow](http://www.zillow.com) is a web site that take an address – maybe your **home address**,  maybe your boss’s, maybe your **arch** enemy’s – and shows you a lot of information about the property, especially an estimate of it’s current market value and how it’s changed. **Cool**.
