Check out [this

** There’s an interesting [news 
 brief in today’s *N.Y. Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/01/business/01drill.html?ex=1325307600&en=3b3245c625ca32b5&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) about a report just 
 issued by the [Food Marketing 
 Institute](http://www.fmi.org/facts_figs/) about shoplifting in supermarkets. In previous years, 
 health and beauty products were the most frequently shoplifted items, 
 making up 23% of all stolen items in 2000. [snip…] 

 “The report also suggested,” Mindlin writes, “that self-service 
 checkout lanes, where customers scan and pay for their purchases 
 themselves, are surprisingly theft-free. Of the roughly 5,400 stores 
 in the survey with self-checkout lanes, 63.6 percent reported no 
 increase in theft rates.”
