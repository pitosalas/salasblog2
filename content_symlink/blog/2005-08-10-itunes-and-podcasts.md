This is just a quickie: did you know that you can just drag and drop the URL of a Podcast RSS feed (a.k.a. an RSS Feed with enclosures) onto the Podcasts list in iTunes? In other words, you donâ€™t need to surf the Apple iTunes catalog looking for your favorite show if you have the URL. This is especially handy if the Podcast you want to listen to has not made it to their catalog.
