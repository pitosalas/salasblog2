Guy Kawasaki with [another one of his great posts](http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/05/the_top_ten_lie_1.html). He’s always fun to read. And boy, do they ring true!

- “I already have a meeting at lunch.” 

- “I think what you’re doing is interesting, but it’s not something for us.” 

- “You need me more than I need you.” 

- “It’s a pleasure to speak here today.” 

- “I can help you partner with Apple.”

- “I don’t care about making money with my blog.”

- “It’s not the money.” 

- “We don’t have a position at Garage or in our portfolio, but I’ll keep you in mind.” 

- “I didn’t mean to slash/trip/board or knock you down.” 

- “Macintosh has lots of software.”
