It is said that you can’t be a true [Web 2.0 ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web2.0)application without an API to enable mashups and such goodies. 

Well, [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) joins the crowd by [ opening up their system to developers](http://developers.facebook.com/). Also check out their [terms of service](http://developers.facebook.com/tos.php).
