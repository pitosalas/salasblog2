Ned Batchelder, my pal, points out that:

> 
“Like the Super Bowl, Christmas is one concentrated day. For celebrants, it is the only thing happening that day, and it’s preceded by weeks of anticipation and preparation. Another similarity is the zeal with which businesses try to piggy-back on the excitement.” (**from** [Ned Batchelder’s Blog)](http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201112/happy_hanukkah.html)

He ends sweetly:

> 
“While the daylight passes as it normally would, the evenings are spent specially, and the entire week is tinged with a special feeling because of it. If you have to miss one night for another reason, that’s OK, you’ve got others you can celebrate.” (**from** [Ned Batchelder’s Blog)](http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201112/happy_hanukkah.html)

(yeah, you heard me, I called Ned sweet 🙂
