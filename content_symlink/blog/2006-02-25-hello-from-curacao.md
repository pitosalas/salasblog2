I’ve discovered how hard it is to work on a laptop with a tiny screen, 1.2GHz and, esepcially, 256Mb of memory. Sloooooow! I’ve been keeping up with emails but not really getting into a blogging mindset. This is just a cheat post to make my blog not appear dead 🙂 
Curacao? Those of you who know me, know. Those who do not, probably don’t know where Curacao is. Look it up on a map. A little island (and I mean little) in the Caribean, right off the coast of South America. It’s where I was born and grew up,so I get back here regularly. Nice.
