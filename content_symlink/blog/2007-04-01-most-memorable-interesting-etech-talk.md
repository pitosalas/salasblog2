I don’t want to label myself as a fuddie-duddie. I keep thinking back to this talk at ETech. [Quinn Norton](http://www.ambiguous.org/quinn/) is a engaging and funny speaker who talked about [“body hacking” (click to see the slides)](http://www.ambiguous.org/quinn/bodyhacking.html)
I learned things like what “Furries” are, that people (including Quinn) have implanted [rare earth magnets into their finger tips](http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mods/news/2006/06/71087), literally trying to get a sixth sense, what [provigil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil) is, and lots of other wonders. As I said, a [memorable talk](http://www.ambiguous.org/quinn/bodyhacking.html).

I learned new things. If that makes me a fuddie-duddie, so be it 😉
