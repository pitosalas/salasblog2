Welcome back [Chris Lydon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lydon)! Those of you who have lived in the Boston area for a while (and who are NPR listeners) will recognize the name. Chris has been on local and national TV and radio, and a couple of years ago did some really early, innovative podcasting work ([yes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting), [before Adam Curry](http://archive.scripting.com/2005/05/14#When:8:02:28AM) üôÇ

Anyway, he is launching a new radio show, called ‚ÄúOpen Source‚Äù, and he is **debugging** it in public, which is **pretty cool**! [Check out the show‚Äôs blog](http://www.radioopensource.org/) for background and also links to the first three beta test shows. **They‚Äôre great!**

Amusingly the latest show on his site is about Wikipedia (of which I am a huge fan) and this is [Wikipedia‚Äôs entry about Chris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lydon)! (*Wheels within wheels*!)
