Robert X. Cringely’s  [prescription for Detroit automakers](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2008/pulpit_20081126_005507.html):
> “So the trick to turning around the U.S. auto industry is to make car buyers adopt the values of bicycle buyers, which implies the willingness to pay $20 per pound of final product. The way to achieve that goal is by building cars that are both affordable at $20 per pound and EXCITING TO DRIVE.” (from [I Cringely, Saving Detroit](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2008/pulpit_20081126_005507.html))
