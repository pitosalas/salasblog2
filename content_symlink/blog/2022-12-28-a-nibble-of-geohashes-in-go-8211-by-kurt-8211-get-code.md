[ A Nibble of Geohashes in Go – by Kurt – Get Code]( https://getcode.substack.com/p/a-nibble-of-geohashes-in-go?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) –This is a really cool algorithm that i never heard of. Also geohashes are not too hard to compute and have very useful and unteresting properties. the concept of a z-order curve is explained. That too is a useful model and concept. The author says: “Latitude and longitude as a locality-preserving string.”
