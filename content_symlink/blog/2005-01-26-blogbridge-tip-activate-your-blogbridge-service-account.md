*(If you are not a BlogBridge you will not find this very interesting)*
We notice many of you have requested a BlogBridge account but not activated it. Hereâ€™s the thing: once you ask for the account, you will receive an email with a link in it that you have to click. Until you click, your account will not be ready to us. (Our instructions need to be improved!) 

Why activate? Because until you do, the wonderful benefits of the BlogBridge service will not be available to you!
