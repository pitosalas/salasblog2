# Center Cam Standard Package

**URL:** https://thecentercam.com/products/center-cam-standard-package
**Type:** link
**Domain:** thecentercam.com

**Excerpt:** Center Cam Standard Package includes: Center Cam Assembly, Adjustable clip mount, Lens Privacy cover. Center Cam Specs: 1080p Resolution, F2.1 lens, 30 FPS, 65 degree Horizontal Field of View. Compatible with Windows, Mac, Android, and Linux. USB-A/USB-C. Adjustable Clip Mount Specs: Opens up to 2". Unit is 5 Ft. long

**Notes:**
This seems like a very good tool! We do so many zoom calls these days, not to mention teaching over zoom. We’re used to the off center eye contact. But I wonder whether people will notice when you use this that you’re looking right at them. Maybe it will make you more persuasive or help you do better in negotiations?
