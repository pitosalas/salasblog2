# File: Advanced I/O with Polyphony — Documentation for polyphony (1.1.1)

**URL:** https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/polyphony/file/docs/advanced-io.md
**Type:** link
**Domain:** rubydoc.info

**Notes:**
Filed under things I didn’t know about IO with Ruby. Still love that language! This gem takes advantage of Unix “splices” to speed up IO when reading and writing large amounts of data.
