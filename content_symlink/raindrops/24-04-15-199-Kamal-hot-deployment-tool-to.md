# Kamal: hot deployment tool to watch—or a total game changer?—Martian Chronicles, Evil Martians’ team blog

**URL:** https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/mrsk-hot-deployment-tool-or-total-game-changer
**Type:** article
**Domain:** evilmartians.com

**Excerpt:** The SRE pros at Evil Martians attempt an objective analysis of the promises, applications, and potential of Kamal (formerly known as MRSK), plus things to watch out for.

**Notes:**
An excellent review and investigation of the new hotness in cloud deployment, Kamal. Alternative to K8S and k3s, supposedly much simpler.
