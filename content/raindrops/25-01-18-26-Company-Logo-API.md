# Company Logo API

**URL:** https://clearbit.com/blog/logo?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=show_hn
**Type:** article
**Domain:** clearbit.com

**Excerpt:** Clearbit's free Logo API is still available here in 2021 â€” and still completely 
free.

We never found anything that catered well to company logos. And yet there's a
lot of clear use-cases ranging from setting an organization's default image on
signup to pulling in logos next to job listings.

Clearbit Logo API
The API is incredibly simple, taking a company's domain and returning an image.

GET https://logo.clearbit.com/:domain

Behind the scenes we're using Clearbit's Company API

**Notes:**
Linked is a service that returns the logo for any domain name. I tried it on  salas.com and it worked great!
