excerpt: Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off. There
  may be a handful that just grew by themselves, but usually it takes some sort of
  push to get them going. A good metaphor would be the cranks that car engines had
  before they got electric starters. Once the engine was going, it would keep going,
  but there was a separate and laborious process to get it going.
