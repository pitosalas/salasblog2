# marimo | a next-generation Python notebook

**URL:** https://marimo.io/

**Excerpt:** Explore data and build apps seamlessly with marimo, a next-generation Python notebook.

**Notes:**
I have not tried this yet, but reading this summary – – which is quite comprehensive – – tell me that the authors have really understood something important about Jupiter notebooks and then trying something that could be a whole lot more valuable. When I use Jupiter notebooks. I always get points when the code is getting too complicated or two and I end up moving it to VS code to work on it a software engineering kind of mode.
