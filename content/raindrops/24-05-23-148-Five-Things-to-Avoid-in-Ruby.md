**Excerpt:** We'll dive into five common Ruby mistakes and see how we can combat them.

**Notes:**
Good reminders of good ruby code. Some of these I agree with and som are in the "too clever" category for me. Of course that is in the eye of the beholder. For me, an idiom may be a very clever use of Ruby that you see a lot and so you learn it. And a "too clever" usage is very similar except you hardly ever come across it and so you need to think about it. Yes, it's subjective. What was once too clever for someone today may actually feel clearer than the obvious way of doing something. Yet. there is such a thing as "too clever" code in Ruby as in all languages.
