# How I stopped worrying and loved Makefiles

**URL:** https://gagor.pro/2024/02/how-i-stopped-worrying-and-loved-makefiles/?utm_source=abyteofcodingnewsletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=a-byte-of-coding-issue-396
**Type:** article
**Domain:** gagor.pro

**Excerpt:** First contact with make When I was invited for my first job interview in the IT, I‚Äôve been asked such question:
How would you typically build a program from sources, what commands will you use?
I answered:
It‚Äôs obvious:
./configure make make install Those times belong to the past now and nowadays not many programmers use GNU Make1. Try asking this question and you will see disgust at best.
For many it‚Äôs the fist contact with make and often the last one, but not for me üòâ

**Notes:**
Great reminders on how and why to use the ancient and ubiquitous ‚Äúmake‚Äù tool.
