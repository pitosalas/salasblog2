# Refactoring Gone Wild: Avoiding code smells and cleaning up the mess - iO tech_hub

**URL:** https://techhub.iodigital.com/articles/refactoring-gone-wild-avoiding-code-smells-and-cleaning-up-the-mess

**Excerpt:** Identifying and avoiding bad coding practices, and refactoring them into clean, elegant, self-explanatory code

**Notes:**
Linked is one of the best refactoring “recipe” books I’ve seen. I recognize single one of the patterns that are described! I’ve seen them and I’ve done them. It should be a checklist for beginning devs.
