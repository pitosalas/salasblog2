# GitHub - IDiAL-IMSL/Edurob: Educational robot with support for various drive kinematics

**URL:** https://github.com/IDiAL-IMSL/Edurob

**Excerpt:** Educational robot with support for various drive kinematics - IDiAL-IMSL/Edurob

**Notes:**
A really cool (another one) open source robot "framework". Supports several different steering algorithms. Looks kind of cute too. It is said that the parts can be bought for $250.
