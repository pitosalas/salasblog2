# Debugbar For Ruby on Rails

**URL:** https://debugbar.dev/?utm_source=changelog-news

**Excerpt:** Rails debugging dev tools for faster development. Inspect your request details (queries, logs, cache, jobs and more).

**Notes:**
This is super useful for rails apps. Will it work for other frameworks like Sinatra? I havenâ€™t tried this yet but it looks promising.
