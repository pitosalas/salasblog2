Please test me on the following: pre-money valuation, post-money valuation, investment size, and ownership stakes. I’d like you to ask me three questions in succession. Wait for my answer on each, and then assess my answer. Do not give me the answer, even if I ask. Instead, if I am struggling or get the wrong answer, please give me a hint. Start now with the first question.”
