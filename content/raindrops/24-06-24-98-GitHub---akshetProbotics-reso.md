**URL:** https://github.com/akshetP/robotics-resources?tab=readme-ov-file

**Excerpt:** A complete library of resources that caters to all levels of Roboticists. - akshetP/robotics-resources

**Notes:**
Attached another huge collection of resources relating to robotics. There are some other libraries like this. This makes it difficult when you are searching for one thing or another. Still I thought I would include this here because this is a goldmine!
