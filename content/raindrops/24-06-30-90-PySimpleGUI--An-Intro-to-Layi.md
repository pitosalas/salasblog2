excerpt: PySimpleGUI is a Python GUI that wraps other Python GUI toolkits (Tkinter,
  PySide, wxPython). By abstracting away the complexities of the other GUIs into a
  common API, you can quickly write code that can be rendered using any of those other
  toolkits just by changing the import at the top of your program.

**Excerpt:** PySimpleGUI is a Python GUI that wraps other Python GUI toolkits (Tkinter, PySide, wxPython). By abstracting away the complexities of the other GUIs into a common API, you can quickly write code that can be rendered using any of those other toolkits just by changing the import at the top of your program.

**Notes:**
Linked is a package for creating user interfaces with Python. This is just a reminder to myself that it exists. It looks useful.
