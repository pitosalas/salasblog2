# A few words on Ruby's type annotations state

**URL:** https://zverok.substack.com/p/a-few-words-on-rubys-type-annotations?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sigavdi101
**Type:** article
**Domain:** zverok.substack.com

**Excerpt:** â€¦that were written in a military training camp and accidentally grew to 5k words

**Notes:**
Linked is a deep article about type hints in Ruby. When I say deep, I mean it! Requires an in depth understanding to appreciate or follow. And it illustrates how incredibly tough it is to add a major new low level feature to Ruby or any other mature language.
