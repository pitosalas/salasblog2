# DuckDB as the New jq

**URL:** https://www.pgrs.net/2024/03/21/duckdb-as-the-new-jq/

**Excerpt:** Recently, Iâ€™ve been interested in the DuckDB project (like a SQLite geared towards data applications). And one of the amazing features is that it has many data importers included without requiring extra dependencies. This means it can natively read and parse JSON as a database table, among many other formats.

**Notes:**
A useful tool if you work with large quantities of json. Just letting you know!
