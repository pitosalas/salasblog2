**Excerpt:** Imagine that, we have built one monolithic app Cricket Live Score where an admin adds the live match scores into the database, and users use this app to get to know the current score about the live match. Match like India v Pakistan is very popular and it tends to have lots of traffic. Sometimes app goes down because it canâ€™t handle such heavy traffic.
