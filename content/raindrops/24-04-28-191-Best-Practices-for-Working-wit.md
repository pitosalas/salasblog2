# Best Practices for Working with Large Language Models

**URL:** https://thenewstack.io/7-guiding-principles-for-working-with-llms/
**Type:** article
**Domain:** thenewstack.io

**Excerpt:** Generative AI has revolutionized programming. Based on his own experience, Jon Udell codifies how to partner effectively with LLM assistants.

**Notes:**
We’re all doing it now, right? Using LLMs for all kinds of things? Well here are some useful rules of thumb. By the way, as far as employing a team of assistants, take a look at Poe.com. It’s a single front end to all (almost all) the LLMs out there. And in fact it bakes in the question of what would the other LLMs say to the same prompt. 

A brave new world!
