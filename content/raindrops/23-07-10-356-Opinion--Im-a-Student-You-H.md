# Opinion | I’m a Student. You Have No Idea How Much We’re Using ChatGPT.

**URL:** https://www.chronicle.com/article/im-a-student-you-have-no-idea-how-much-were-using-chatgpt?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=campaign_7214412_nl_Academe-Today_date_20230710&cid=at&source=&sourceid=

**Notes:**
