# Ronynn's Blog Overthinking Analytically - Game Development, Tech, Productivity & Writing

**URL:** https://ronynn.github.io/ruby-might-be-better-than-python/
**Type:** article
**Domain:** ronynn.github.io

**Excerpt:** Explore Ronynn's insights on game development, tech, productivity, and writing.

**Notes:**
Attached is an article that is guaranteed to be clickbait for my people. Certainly for me! I use both Ruby and Python. Lately more python because the stuff I am working on uses Python. And let’s face it Python is, generally speaking, a more mainstream language. I don’t find the arguments made in the attached article especially compelling. I would say that Ruby and Python are more similar than different but in the end, for many reasons, I would use Ruby if I had a choice.
