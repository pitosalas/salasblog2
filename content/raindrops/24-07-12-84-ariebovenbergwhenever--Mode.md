# ariebovenberg/whenever: ⏰ Modern datetime library for Python, written in Rust

**URL:** https://github.com/ariebovenberg/whenever

**Excerpt:** ⏰ Modern datetime library for Python, written in Rust - ariebovenberg/whenever

**Notes:**
Another python “improvement” by providing a Rustlang implementation of a python thing. My thought: “if we keep going down this path, python will become no more than a rustlang preprocessor”😊
