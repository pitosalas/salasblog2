# Exercise: Minesweeper in 100 lines of clean Ruby

**URL:** https://radanskoric.com/experiments/minesweeper-100-lines-of-clean-ruby
**Type:** article
**Domain:** radanskoric.com

**Excerpt:** Ruby is such an expressive language. You can often do surprisingly much with just a few lines of code. It’s why I find it so satisfying to think about how to accomplish the same thing in fewer lines of Ruby1. If we accept the claim that that number of bugs correlates with number of lines of code this is not just a fun exercise. There’s real business value in accomplishing a feature with less lines of code. ↩

**Notes:**
Reading well written, idiomatic code is the best way to improve your code. Linked is a nice example.
