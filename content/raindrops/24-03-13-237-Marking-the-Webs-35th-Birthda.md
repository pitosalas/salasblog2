# Marking the Web’s 35th Birthday: An Open Letter

**URL:** https://medium.com/@timberners_lee/marking-the-webs-35th-birthday-an-open-letter-ebb410cc7d42
**Type:** article
**Domain:** medium.com

**Excerpt:** Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s open letter to mark the occasion of the Web’s 35th Birthday.

**Notes:**
This is a quite interesting letter, advocating the creation of a privately owned data store for every user of the web. It’s a grand vision coming from somebody who has huge influence. that someone is Tim Berners-Lee, the so-called inventor of the World Wide Web. By the way he used the NeXT computer to create the original prototype, which is a pretty interesting historical note.
