# An Introduction to Nix for Ruby Developers

**URL:** https://blog.appsignal.com/2024/08/07/an-introduction-to-nix-for-ruby-developers.html?utm_source=ruby-magic&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=rss-email&utm_content=button

**Excerpt:** Learn how to build and share reproducible Rails development environments.

**Notes:**
Wow, I've heard about Nix from time to time. I still don't understand it. But the linked article is the first fairly comprehensive one with a detailed tutorial. Of course I am still too scared to try typing in the commands. They seem to claim that it will be totally isolated but still. Mainly I am not sure what benefit I will get in trying it. You can see though, that someone's have put a ton of effort into getting it to this point.
