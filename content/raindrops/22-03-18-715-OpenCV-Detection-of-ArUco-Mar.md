# OpenCV: Detection of ArUco Markers

**URL:** https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html

**Excerpt:** Pose estimation is of great importance in many computer vision applications: robot navigation, augmented reality, and many more. This process is based on finding correspondences between points in the real environment and their 2d image projection. This is usually a difficult step, and thus it is common to use synthetic or fiducial markers to make it easier.
