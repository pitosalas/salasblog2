# Explain that stuff! Science and technology made simple

**URL:** https://www.explainthatstuff.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email
**Type:** link
**Domain:** explainthatstuff.com

**Excerpt:** We make science and technology easy to understand.

**Notes:**
Quick glance at this site gives me the impression that this is a plausible alternative Wikipedia for less exhaustive explanations for how stuff works.
