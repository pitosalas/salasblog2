# Falsehoods programmers believe about time zones

**URL:** https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time-zones/
**Type:** article
**Domain:** zainrizvi.io

**Excerpt:** I decided to make a time zone converter. It had seemed like an easy project, but I was horribly mistaken

**Notes:**
I always enjoy articles with misconceptions. Timezones is one of those boring topics that drive programmers crazy and eat up a disproportionate amount of coding time!
