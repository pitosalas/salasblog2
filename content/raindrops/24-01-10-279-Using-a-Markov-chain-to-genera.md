# Using a Markov chain to generate readable nonsense with 20 lines of Python

**URL:** https://benhoyt.com/writings/markov-chain/

**Excerpt:** Describes a simple Markov chain algorithm to generate reasonable-sounding but utterly nonsensical text, and presents some example outputs as well as a Python implementation.

**Notes:**
A neat explanation of markov chains and some python code to look at too!
