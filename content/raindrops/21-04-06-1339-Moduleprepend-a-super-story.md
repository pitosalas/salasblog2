excerpt: I was super excited when I first heard about the prepend feature included
  in the Ruby 2.0 release, but never had a chance to use it. Micah Cooper and I were
  working in an existing code base recently, and one of the project's requirements
  was to log API requests that took longer than a given threshold. The project talked
  to multiple APIs via XML, JSON and SOAP. We didn't want to change the existing code,
  because it had been tested and was working in production.
