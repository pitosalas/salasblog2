# Regexp Preprocessor

**URL:** https://pomsky-lang.org/docs/get-started/introduction/
**Type:** article
**Domain:** pomsky-lang.org

**Notes:**
Interesting but not for me. I know regexps are arcane and confusing but they are well documented and people know them. I put this in the same bucket as scss and sass and many other helpful pre-processors. Not for me. Of course, you may not know that C++ started out literally as a C pre-processor (called cfront) that would generate C. So... The author says: "Summary of what pomsky is and what it looks like. Pomsky is a language that compiles to regular expressions. It is currently in an alpha stage and will likely change in the next few releases."
