# Visual Data Structures Cheat-Sheet

**Excerpt:** A visual overview of some of the key data-structures used in the real world.

**Notes:**
Linked is a very comprehensive collection of brief explanations of numerous computer science-y data structures. I put it that way because when I think of a data structure and designing a data structure it is to represent some domain data in a way that is most convenient for the algorithm or requirements. 

The linked article gets into advanced data structures seem mostly about efficiently storing, accessing, searching and updating very large collections of information. I say very large because the structures and associated algorithms are nuanced and ingenious in order to achieve efficiency when subjected to very large collections.  When you need one, you really need it and it can save your application. But you wonâ€™t need most of them every day. IMHO of course.
