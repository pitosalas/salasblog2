# Python packages with pyproject.toml and nothing else

**URL:** https://til.simonwillison.net/python/pyproject

**Excerpt:** I've been using setuptools and setup.py for my Python packages for a long time: I like that it works without me having to think about installing and learning any additional tools such as Flit or pip-tools or Poetry or Hatch .

**Notes:**
Super useful somewhat demystification of the #chaotic world of #python #packaging
