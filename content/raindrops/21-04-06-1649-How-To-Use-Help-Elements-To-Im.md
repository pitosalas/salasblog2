excerpt: 'When designing a website, the most important thing is to **make it as usable
  and convenient as possible**. On a website on which users could possibly get confused,
  it is best to include help elements. Help elements come in all different shapes
  and sizes: an entire page, a suggestion box or a quick tip. But they all have one
  thing in common: besides doing the obvious (i.e. helping the user), help elements
  provide an extra convenience that brings the website closer to that sought-after
  usability. With the number of forms, search functions and other navigational elements
  on websites these days...'
