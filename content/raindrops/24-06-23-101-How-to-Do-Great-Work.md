# How to Do Great Work

**URL:** https://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html

**Notes:**
The attached essay by Paul Graham  gives his views on how someone can think about finding the right project to work on. Not a job but work that is their own. I love this quote: “What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that would bore most other people? That's what you're looking for”. I’m personally familiar with “a degree that would bore most other people”.
