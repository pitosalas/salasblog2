# Sonic Pi: Ruby as a Composition Tool

**URL:** https://bhmt.dev/blog/sonic_pi/

**Notes:**
Linked is a neat article about sonic pi, a less known music synthesizer software. It is so cool and interesting even if youâ€™re not a musician or composer. It builds a world of musical abstractions allowing you to make very interesting music. What is news from this article is that the whole thing is built on top of Ruby, as a DSL!
