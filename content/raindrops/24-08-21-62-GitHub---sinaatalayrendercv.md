# GitHub - sinaatalay/rendercv: A LaTeX CV/Resume Framework

**URL:** https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv

**Excerpt:** A LaTeX CV/Resume Framework. Contribute to sinaatalay/rendercv development by creating an account on GitHub.

**Notes:**
Kinda cool. Linked is a simple tool which formats a cv in one of several styles. But the trick is that the input is a yaml file which contains all the content as a structured text file that you can edit with vscode and version track with GitHub. Nice!
