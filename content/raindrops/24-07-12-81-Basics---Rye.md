# Basics - Rye

**URL:** https://rye.astral.sh/guide/basics/

**Excerpt:** An Experimental Package Management Solution for Python

**Notes:**
See attached info about RYE. Ok so I complain that python has so many different package managers, virtual environment mechanisms, dependency managers, and so on. Much to my chagrin, I recently read something saying, “whatever you do, don’t use poetry”. 

Rye But, but, but… rye looks really nice from the linked description. I’m just a little hesitant to lock myself to rye and find myself in 6 months having to do something totally different. 

By the way I happen to be a happy user of rbenv (@ Ruby environment manager) so my default is pyenv, which works the same way exactly. Not sure if they are from the same person, but they are basically identical.
