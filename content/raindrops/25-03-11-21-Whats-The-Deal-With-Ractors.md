# Whatâ€™s The Deal With Ractors?

**URL:** https://byroot.github.io/ruby/performance/2025/02/27/whats-the-deal-with-ractors.html?utm_source=tldrwebdev
**Type:** article
**Domain:** byroot.github.io

**Excerpt:** I want to write a post about Pitchfork, explaining where it comes from, why it is like it is, and how I see its future. But before I can get to that, I think I need to share my mental model on a few things, in this case, Ractors.

**Notes:**
Linked is a good explanation of Ruby ractors, and a reminder that they still exist!
