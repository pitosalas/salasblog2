# Let's Implement the Map Method from First Principles

**URL:** https://www.akshaykhot.com/map-from-first-principles/?ref=akshays-blog-newsletter
**Type:** article
**Domain:** akshaykhot.com

**Excerpt:** Those new to functional programming often wonder when to use higher-order functions (or blocks/procs/lambdas in Ruby). I did, too. In this post, we'll implement the map method from scratch, in turn gaining an intuitive understanding of higher-order functions and when to use them.

**Notes:**
Great article explaining Ruby map, lambda and proc.
