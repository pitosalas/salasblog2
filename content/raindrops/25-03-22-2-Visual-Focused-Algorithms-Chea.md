# Visual-Focused Algorithms Cheat Sheet

**URL:** https://open.substack.com/pub/photonlines/p/visual-focused-algorithms-cheat-sheet?r=1slq0e&utm_medium=ios

**Excerpt:** A visual-focused review of some key practical algorithms used in the real world.

**Notes:**
Linked is a super useful directory of many or most of the classic foundational Computer Science algorithms. No, there was no PID or Kalman Filter but those are a bit specialized.
