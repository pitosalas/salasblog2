# ROS opencv camera driver that uses cv::VideoCapture

**URL:** https://github.com/OTL/cv_camera

**Excerpt:** ROS opencv camera driver that uses cv::VideoCapture - OTL/cv_camera

**Notes:**
Ok this is also for me to remember important links! Here is the source code for the opencv ROS support for the camera. I now prefer it over Raspicam.
