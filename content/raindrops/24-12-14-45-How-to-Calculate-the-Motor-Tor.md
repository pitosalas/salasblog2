excerpt: This guide outlines how to calculate power parameters for a mobile robot
  and select an appropriate power system. We cover frictional and acceleration forces,
  wheel type, and motor parameters to design a direct-drive system with a brushless
  motor. With the rated voltage, speed, and torque of the motor, we calculate the
  required power and minimum battery capacity to power the robot successfully. This
  discussion is a valuable resource for designing or selecting a power system for
  an indoor, service-oriented mobile robot capable of carrying a payload of 20 kg
  and achieving a speed of 1.

# How to Calculate the Motor Torque for a Mobile Robot

**Excerpt:** This guide outlines how to calculate power parameters for a mobile robot and select an appropriate power system. We cover frictional and acceleration forces, wheel type, and motor parameters to design a direct-drive system with a brushless motor. With the rated voltage, speed, and torque of the motor, we calculate the required power and minimum battery capacity to power the robot successfully. This discussion is a valuable resource for designing or selecting a power system for an indoor, service-oriented mobile robot capable of carrying a payload of 20 kg and achieving a speed of 1.

**Notes:**
Linked is an article explaining how to calculate torque. But why? When choosing a motor for a robot, you need to calculate the torque required, which in turn depends on the weight of the robot, the diameter of the wheels, and other parameters.
