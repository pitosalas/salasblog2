# cantino/mcfly: Fly through your shell history. Great Scott!

**URL:** https://github.com/cantino/mcfly

**Excerpt:** Fly through your shell history. Great Scott! Contribute to cantino/mcfly development by creating an account on GitHub.

**Notes:**
Linked is another bash history editor. Much lighter weight. I much prefer it. It works on Linux and Mac and everything!
