# Jade Rubick - Unusual tips to keep Slack from becoming a nightmare

**Type:** article

**Excerpt:** Use the tips to improve your org's use of Slack: answers to questions should take longer than the time to look it up, notifications should go to a few people, the more people in a room, the more structured it should be. Plus a few more.

**Notes:**
We use slack a lot at work. These are some helpful tips to reduce noise and increase communication. When there are four different ways to communicate (email, slack, sms, and posting to a forum) you have a lot of wasted time. Yes each way has a slightly different purpose and effect, but four are too many!
