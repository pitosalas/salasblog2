# What can agents actually do?

**URL:** https://lethain.com/what-can-agents-do/?utm_source=tldrwebdev
**Type:** article
**Domain:** lethain.com

**Excerpt:** There’s a lot of excitement about what AI (specifically the latest wave of LLM-anchored AI) can do,
and how AI-first companies are different from the prior generations of companies.
There are a lot of important and real opportunities at hand, but I find that many of these conversations
occur at such an abstract altitude that they border on meaningless.
Sort of like saying that your company could be much better if you merely adopted more software. That’s certainly true,
but it’s not a particularly helpful claim.

**Notes:**
Linked is a really good explanation of LLM agents, what they do, how they work more or less, and what they COULD do.
