# Python's many command-line utilities

**URL:** https://www.pythonmorsels.com/cli-tools/#just-for-fun
**Type:** article
**Domain:** pythonmorsels.com

**Excerpt:** Every command-line tool included with Python. These can be run with python -m module_name.

**Notes:**
You might find something useful in the attached article. The big one for me is the explanation of what the -m flag does.
