# Find Out Why Health Insurance Denied Your Claim

**URL:** https://projects.propublica.org/claimfile/

**Excerpt:** You likely have the right to access records that explain why your insurer denied your claim or prior authorization request. Use ProPublicaâ€™s free tool to generate a letter requesting your claim file from your health insurance company.

**Notes:**
We all will get a claim rejected at some point. Sometimes not a very big deal, other times a huge deal. This web site is recommended as a tool to figure out what happened and how perhaps get the decision reversed.
