# Deploying Ruby on Rails with Dokku (including Redis, Sidekiq, ARM servers and Docker).

**URL:** https://railsnotes.xyz/blog/deploying-ruby-on-rails-with-dokku-redis-sidekiq-arm-docker-hetzner?utm_source=shortruby&utm_campaign=shortruby_0049
**Type:** article
**Domain:** railsnotes.xyz

**Excerpt:** This is the ultimate Dokku + Ruby on Rails guide â€” I cover running Dokku on x86 and ARM, deploying Sidekiq and Redis, dockerizing our Ruby on Rails app, and more...

**Notes:**
Dokku is one of several do-it-yourself heroku replacements which started getting attention when Heroku terminated their free tier.
