# Introducing scikit-geometry

**URL:** https://wolfv.medium.com/introducing-scikit-geometry-ae1dccaad5fd
**Type:** article
**Domain:** wolfv.medium.com

**Excerpt:** One of those libraries that I was going to write, then I thought, someone else must have already written it. Then I googled and found: "The Python ecosystem is lacking a library with useful geometric types — we aim to fix this by introducing scikit-geometry."
