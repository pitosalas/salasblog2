# PID controller | Wikiwand

**URL:** https://www.wikiwand.com/en/PID_controller

**Excerpt:** A proportional–integral–derivative controller is a control loop mechanism employing feedback that is widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value.

**Notes:**
Very important control algorithm. Used a lot in robotics but many other ways.
