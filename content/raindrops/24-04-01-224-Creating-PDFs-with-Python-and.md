# Creating PDFs with Python and ReportLab's Canvas (Part I)

**URL:** https://open.substack.com/pub/pypapers/p/creating-pdfs-with-python-and-reportlabs?r=1slq0e&utm_medium=ios
**Type:** article
**Domain:** open.substack.com

**Excerpt:** ReportLab is a very powerful library. With a little effort, you can make pretty much any layout that you can think of. I have used it to replicate many complex page layouts over the years. In this tutorial, you will be learning how to use ReportLabâ€™s

**Notes:**
Always useful to know how to generate pdfs! The thought in my head: I still like Ruby a little better as a language. But Python shares with Ruby that it has a. absolutely huge ecosystem of useful packages.
