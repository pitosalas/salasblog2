# A decent VS Code + Ruby on Rails setup

**URL:** https://railsnotes.xyz/blog/vscode-rails-setup?utm_source=railsnotes.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=the-railsnotes-newsletter-issue-28

**Excerpt:** Setting up VS Code for Ruby on Rails development can be tricky, so I wrote this article to help. In it, I share different VS Code extensions for things like autocomplete, linting, formatting and more! I've even put together a handy extension pack to get you setup fast.

**Notes:**
An update on vscode for ruby and rails. This stuff is covered all the time but itâ€™s worth seeing it again because the world changes and the recommendations also change.
