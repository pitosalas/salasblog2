# Silicon Valley’s Best Kept Secret: Founder Liquidity

**URL:** https://www.stefantheard.com/silicon-valleys-best-kept-secret-founder-liquidity/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav
**Type:** article
**Domain:** stefantheard.com

**Excerpt:** Ask most venture-backed founders why they get 10x more equity than employee #1, 100x more equity than employee #5, and 1000x more equity than employee #15, and you'll get the same answer: "I'M TAKING SO MUCH RISK, IT'S SO HARD TO START A COMPANY, I MADE A BIG MOVE!!!" And

**Notes:**
Another reason why I believe being the founder of a well funded startup is not risky. If the startup is indeed well funded then you as a founder or employee can count on your salary for say between one and three years. No matter what revenue or earnings are, because they are not expected at the very start. Compare that with a job at an established company where layoffs can come out of nowhere and affect anyone.  Not sure which is riskier … it depends … but in my opinion the startup is not clearly riskier. See the attached article for an explanation of one factor, but not the only factor.
