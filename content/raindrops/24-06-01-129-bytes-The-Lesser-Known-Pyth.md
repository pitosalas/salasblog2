# `bytes`: The Lesser-Known Python Built-In Sequence â€¢ And Understanding UTF-8 Encoding

**URL:** https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/bytes-python-built-in-unicode-utf-8-encoding?r=1slq0e&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true

**Excerpt:** The `bytes` data type looks a bit like a string, but it isn't a string. Let's explore it and also look at the main Unicode encoding, UTF-8

**Notes:**
Ever wanted to understand UTF8 better? Every programming language does it a little different but utf8 is utf8. This article explains it well, in general, and specifically for python.
