# Do I not like Ruby anymore?

**URL:** https://sgt.hootr.club/molten-matter/maybe-i-like-python-now/

**Excerpt:** steenuil's blog

**Notes:**
This is almost exactly how I feel about Ruby and Python. I use Python more now and I really like the way they did type hints. I really dislike what Ruby did. Who needs a second file to deal with. It's back to C header files! So fundamentally I know Ruby better and there are multiple things that I miss. Surprisingly I have gotten totally used to Python's indentation based blocks. I hated those initially. Now I still hate Python's braindead way of creating and working with classes. But... Python is growing on me!
