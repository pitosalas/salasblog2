# What is Standards-based Grading? - TeacherEase

**URL:** https://www.teacherease.com/standards-based-grading.aspx
**Type:** link
**Domain:** teacherease.com

**Notes:**
"Standards-based grading (SBG) is an innovation in education that focuses on learning and helps increase achievement. It is often combined with updated instructional practices and culture to better engage students and foster a positive environment. This page is an introduction for parents and educators new to standards-based education."Explaining Standards Based Grading, which I think is almost the same as Specs Based Grading. Another concept I am learing about.
