# Jade Rubick - Implementing Amazon's single threaded owner model a retrospective

**URL:** https://www.rubick.com/implementing-amazons-single-threaded-owner-model/?utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Implementing%20Amazon%27s%20single%20threaded%20owner%20model,%20a%20retrospective%20-%204537069

**Excerpt:** A Single Threaded Owner (STO), is a single leader that is completely responsible for their area of the product. I share my experiences implementing this model, including the tradeoffs and challenges. And I give the nuts and bolts of how we implemented it and what we learned.

**Notes:**
The attached article describes an org structure apparently originated at Amazon, called “single threaded owner” or STO. In a company with multiple products, one common setup is to have separate dev, pm and design groups each covering all products. STO says to have a separate, single manager for each product, the STO. Interesting idea.
