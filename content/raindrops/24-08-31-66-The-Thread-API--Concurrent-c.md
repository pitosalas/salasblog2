# The Thread API : Concurrent, colorless Ruby

**URL:** https://jpcamara.com/2024/08/26/the-thread-api.html
**Type:** link
**Domain:** jpcamara.com

**Excerpt:** üëãüèº This is part of series on concurrency, parallelism and asynchronous programming in Ruby. It‚Äôs a deep dive, so it‚Äôs divided into 12 main parts:
 Your Ruby programs are always multi-threaded: Part 1 Your Ruby programs are always multi-threaded: Part 2 Consistent, request-local state Ruby methods are colorless The Thread API: Concurrent, colorless Ruby Interrupting Threads: Concurrent, colorless Ruby Thread and its MaNy friends: Concurrent, colorless Ruby Fibers: Concurrent, colorless Ruby Processes, Ractors and alternative runtimes: Parallel Ruby Scaling concurrency: Streaming Ruby Abstracted, concurrent Ruby Closing thoughts, kicking the tires and tangents How I dive into CRuby concurrency  You‚Äôre reading ‚ÄúThe Thread API: Concurrent, colorless Ruby‚Äù.

**Notes:**
Linked is a really excellent, comprehensive tour of the Thread class and feature of Ruby. If you're a ruby person, then this is as good as anything you will find.
