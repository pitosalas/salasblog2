# 1 dataset, 100 matplotlib visualizations â€“ Curbal

**URL:** https://curbal.com/1-dataset-100-matplotlib-visualizations

**Excerpt:** The 1 dataset, 100 matplotlib visualizations,  displays 100charts made with matplotlib. Just click on a thumbnail to get to the full code.

**Notes:**
If you've used Matplotlib, you may have seen their galleries and various other galleries. Attached is what looks to me like a MEGA gallery by someone who has really good aesthetic sense. (Joke: "Almost as good as ChatGPT")
