# BrowserAI: Run local LLMs inside your browser

**URL:** https://github.com/sauravpanda/BrowserAI?utm_source=tldrnewsletter

**Excerpt:** Run local LLMs inside your browser. Contribute to sauravpanda/BrowserAI development by creating an account on GitHub.

**Notes:**
This could be important. Linked is a tool that allows you to run an LLM locally in your browser. Why is that interesting? After all you can already run it locally, just on your laptop. I think, if this thing works, one can provide LLM features as part of a SaS app, while guaranteeing your users that their information is staying with them and not going into “the cloud”.
