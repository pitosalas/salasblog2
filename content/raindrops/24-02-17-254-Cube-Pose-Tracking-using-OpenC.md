# Cube Pose Tracking using OpenCV and ArUco in ROS: A Step-by-Step Guide

**URL:** https://medium.com/@ammar.n.abbas/cube-pose-tracking-using-aruco-in-ros-a-step-by-step-guide-1801a82fc546

**Excerpt:** Introduction

**Notes:**
I am looking for a substitute for fideucials with ROS. I have used raspicam_node from Ubiquity Robotics and it does work but it took a lot of playing. I wonder if opencv would work better.
