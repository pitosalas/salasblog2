# Python Protocols: Leveraging Structural Subtyping – Real Python

**URL:** https://realpython.com/python-protocol/

**Excerpt:** In this tutorial, you'll learn about Python's protocols and how they can help you get the most out of using Python's type hint system and static type checkers.

**Notes:**
I didn’t understand Protocols in Python. Linked is an excellent tutorial that explains not just Protocols, but also contrasts them with duck typing, abstract base classes, talks about use cases and non-use cases. It’s an advanced tutorial.
