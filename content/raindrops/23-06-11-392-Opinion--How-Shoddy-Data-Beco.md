**URL:** https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-shoddy-data-becomes-sensational-research?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=campaign_7001852_nl_Academe-Today_date_20230608&cid=at&source=&sourceid=&sra=true
**Type:** article

**Excerpt:** Academics are addicted to p-hacking, data torturing, and other statistical sins. We must break these habits.

**Notes:**
As early as 2005, alarm bells were going off over unrigorous social-science research — that was the year John P.A. Ioannidis, a Stanford professor of medicine, published “Why Most Published Research Findings Are False” in PLOS Medicine.
