# Write code top-down

**URL:** https://www.teamten.com/lawrence/programming/write-code-top-down.html?utm_source=abyteofcodingnewsletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=a-byte-of-coding-issue-361

**Notes:**
Nice article but I disagree with the conclusion. I have found that you need to combine the two and go back and forth. There is no single way. By the way, notice that if you believe in TDD, that approach generally starts bottom up (UNITs are at the bottom.) so whatever design comes out of that process would be bottom up.
