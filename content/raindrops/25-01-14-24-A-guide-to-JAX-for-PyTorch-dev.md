**Excerpt:** PyTorch users can learn about JAX in this tutorial that connects JAX concepts to the PyTorch building blocks that theyâ€™re already familiar with.

**Notes:**
Linked is a very useful tutorial on the use of JAX. I am not an expert. I capture the link here mostly for my own future benefit.
