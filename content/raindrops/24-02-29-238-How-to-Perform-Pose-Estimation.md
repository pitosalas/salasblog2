# How to Perform Pose Estimation Using an ArUco Marker â€“ Automatic Addison

**URL:** https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-perform-pose-estimation-using-an-aruco-marker/

**Notes:**
One of many articles helping with the math of computing pose from aruco markers. Unfortunately the algorithms are different and give different results.

By the way the Automatic Addison web site is a treasure trove of robotics ideas, explainers and code.
