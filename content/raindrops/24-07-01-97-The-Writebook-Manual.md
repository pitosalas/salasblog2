# The Writebook Manual

**URL:** https://books.37signals.com/2/the-writebook-manual?utm_source=shortruby&ref=shortruby.com
**Type:** link
**Domain:** books.37signals.com

**Excerpt:** A new way to publish a book to the web

**Notes:**
Attached is an elegant new product (at least its prerelease documentation) to “publish a book” to the web. I believe it will be a single license software product that you get to deploy to a server, including a cloud server. There are of course numerous ways of doing this but 37signals.com’s stuff is always excellent and beautiful.
