# An Introduction to Auth0 for Ruby on Rails | AppSignal Blog

**URL:** https://blog.appsignal.com/2024/07/17/an-introduction-to-auth0-for-ruby-on-rails.html

**Excerpt:** This article will cover the setup and use of Auth0 in a Ruby on Rails application.

**Notes:**
The attached article is a nice introduction to the auth0 service and tooling. Definity worth considering for your app. Authentication is a tricky thing to implement, and thatâ€™s before worrying about perfect security. The one thing that I am a little shaky on is relying on a paid service for authentication. What if I lose connectivity to the service or my credit card expires?
