# Dokku: my favorite personal serverless platform – Hamel’s Blog

**URL:** https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/dokku/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav

**Excerpt:** Like Heroku, but you own it.

**Notes:**
Linked is an article about #dokku which is software that lets you run the equivalent (more or less) of #heroku on your own server, including a server instance from a service like #digitalocean. Very nice. Good offering to remember!dokku
