# Glicol

**URL:** https://glicol.org/

**Excerpt:** Music programming in the browser

**Notes:**
Linked is a tool for writing electronic sounding music 5hrough a cryptic language, right in the browser. It reminds me of SonicPi except with a far worse syntax. But it runs in the browser which is pretty cool!
