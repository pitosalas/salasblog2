# Understanding Hash Value Omission in Ruby

**URL:** https://allaboutcoding.ghinda.com/hash-value-omission-an-introduction-and-some-examples

**Excerpt:** Learn about hash value omission in Ruby, their benefits, examples, and implementation guidelines for more concise code

**Notes:**
Linked is an article about a feature in Ruby that I didn’t know about. I still think Ruby is superior to python in many ways. Unfortunately circumstances and “the world” and “time” has gotten me leaning more and more into python. Still when I next need to create a web based app, I can’t see using Django over rails.
