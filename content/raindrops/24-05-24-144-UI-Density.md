# UI Density

**URL:** https://matthewstrom.com/writing/ui-density/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav

**Excerpt:** I speak and write about design, front-end code, leadership, and (occasionally) math.

**Notes:**
This analysis is quite interesting and reflects I think the way I perceive user interfaces. I wish though that it actually came down on a side and explained whether for example the Bloomberg interface was good or bad and / or how you would create a modern version of the density that the Bloomberg interface has.
