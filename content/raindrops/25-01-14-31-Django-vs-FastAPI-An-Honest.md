# Django vs. FastAPI, An Honest Comparison

**URL:** https://www.david-dahan.com/blog/comparing-fastapi-and-django
**Type:** article
**Domain:** david-dahan.com

**Excerpt:** After many years of working with Django, I decided to take a closer and more serious look at FastAPI.
Extensively using both frameworks has helped me understand their actual strengths and weaknesses with greater accuracy.
More and more, I find it challenging to form a relevant opinion on tools I've never used. Reading documentation or blog posts like this one is not enough, as some things simply don't "click" in your mind until you experience them firsthand.

**Notes:**
Linked is a very useful article comparing FastAPI with Django. I’ve been a long-time Ruby on Rails developer, having developed a lot of expertise using that framework and genuinely loving it. However, for very practical reasons, I recently switched to Python. This article is highly instructive in explaining the pros and cons of Django versus FastAPI. But it leads me to an unexpected conclusion: neither Django nor fast API can truly fulfill my needs as much as Rails. Consequently, I’ve decided to stick to Ruby on Rails, even though I’ve switched to Python as my primary programming language!
