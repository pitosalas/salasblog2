# Cargo Cult Science annotated/explained version.

**URL:** https://fermatslibrary.com/s/cargo-cult-science#email-newsletter

**Excerpt:** Richard Feynman

**Notes:**
I think Richard Feynman coined the term  “cargo cult” in the 70’s! More important is his description of the scientific process, and his high standard and description of integrity in doing science. Computer Scientists, does your research achieve Feynman’s standard?
