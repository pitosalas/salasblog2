**URL:** https://solhsa.com/interpolation/
**Type:** link
**Domain:** solhsa.com

**Notes:**
A visual and simple explanation of the calculations for easing. I am not sure but I think some of this is over complicated. I mean I don't know that we need so many variations. In any event, it is much easier to follow because they pull out the bit that is needed.
