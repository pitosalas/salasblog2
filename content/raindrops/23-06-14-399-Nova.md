# Nova

**URL:** https://nova.app/
**Type:** link
**Domain:** nova.app

**Excerpt:** The beautiful, fast, flexible, native Mac code editor from Panic.

**Notes:**
Looks interesting! Will anything ever lure me away from vscode? Yes: Iâ€™m old enough to know that eventually every programming habit gets superseded by a better one.
