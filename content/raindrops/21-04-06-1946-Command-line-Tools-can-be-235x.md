excerpt: Introduction As I was browsing the web and catching up on some sites I visit
  periodically, I found a cool article from Tom Hayden about using Amazon Elastic
  Map Reduce (EMR) and mrjob in order to compute some statistics on win/loss ratios
  for chess games he downloaded from the millionbase archive, and generally have fun
  with EMR. Since the data volume was only about 1.75GB containing around 2 million
  chess games, I was skeptical of using Hadoop for the task, but I can understand
  his goal of learning and having fun with mrjob and EMR.
