**Notes:**
This seems like a very good tool! We do so many zoom calls these days, not to mention teaching over zoom. We’re used to the off center eye contact. But I wonder whether people will notice when you use this that you’re looking right at them. Maybe it will make you more persuasive or help you do better in negotiations?
