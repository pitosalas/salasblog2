# AI is Creating a Generation of Illiterate Programmers

**URL:** https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-illiterate-programmers?utm_source=changelog-news

**Excerpt:** A couple of days ago, Cursor went down during the ChatGPT outage. I stared at my terminal facing those red error messages that I hate to see. An AWS error glared back at me. I didn’t want to figure it out without AI’s help. After 12 years of coding, I’d somehow become worse at my own craft. And this isn’t hyperbole—this is the new reality for software developers.

**Notes:**
Linked article talks about something I’ve been thinking about. I’ve experienced it myself but not programming. When I delved into an area that the LLM didn’t know as well, it started giving me incorrect hallucinated answers. I went back to regular searches and posting on specific forums!
