# 1969: Can You Land on The Moon? • A Python turtle Lunar Lander

**URL:** https://open.substack.com/pub/thepythoncodingstack/p/python-turtle-lunar-lander-game-1969-land-on-the-moon?r=1slq0e&utm_medium=ios

**Excerpt:** Revisiting one of my favourite projects: a lunar lander using, yes, the one and only turtle module

**Notes:**
Linked is an article about the “turtle” Python package. It’s a simple and elegant API for creating simple visual  animations, simulations and/or games. I had never come across it before and it looks like a good addition to my toolkit.
