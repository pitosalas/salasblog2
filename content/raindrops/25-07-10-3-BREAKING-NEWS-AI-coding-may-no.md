# BREAKING NEWS: AI coding may not be helping as much as you think

**URL:** https://open.substack.com/pub/garymarcus/p/breaking-news-ai-coding-may-not-be?r=1slq0e&utm_medium=ios
**Type:** article
**Domain:** open.substack.com

**Excerpt:** Coding has been the strongest use case. But a new study from METR just dropped.

**Notes:**
Linked is just one interesting data point about coding with ai. Itâ€™s interesting because it is counterintuitive to what everyone thinks. But of course this has to be replicated. I have to say that it is not inconsistent with my own personal experience.
