# Copilot Leaks: Code I Should Not Have Seen

**URL:** https://link.medium.com/hIQS1PoDMAb
**Type:** article
**Domain:** link.medium.com

**Excerpt:** The number of leaked information from Copilot were surprising. Iâ€™ll show you what it his and how to prevent it your code from leaking.

**Notes:**
This is not gonna end well. LLMs learn from public repositories. Those repos will get smart that OpenAI is benefitting from all their work and stop allowing the drawling. See StackOverflow and Reddit. Will the well go dry?
