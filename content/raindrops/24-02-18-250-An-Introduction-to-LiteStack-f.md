# An Introduction to LiteStack for Ruby on Rails | AppSignal Blog

**URL:** https://blog.appsignal.com/2023/09/27/an-introduction-to-litestack-for-ruby-on-rails.html

**Excerpt:** In the first part of this series, we'll set up an example Rails application and introduce the basics of LiteStack.

**Notes:**
A multi part series on the so called LiteStack. People seem to be coming back around to using SQLite for their production databases. This was the way it was a few years ago but then everyone decided that SQLite was a toy and we should use Postgres. Yes, it was a little more complicated and could cost a little more but we were clever enough to figure it out. Well I like this trend to ditching unnecessary complexity (“you are not Facebook”)
