# Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot: The first real AI developer

**URL:** https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot?b=main

**Excerpt:** The first real AI developer. Contribute to Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot development by creating an account on GitHub.

**Notes:**
Interesting. There are more and more of these coming out. For now I doubt they work very well, in practice. However the trend is clear and they will get better and better. Are our jobs at risk? Only if we donâ€™t learn how to use these tools to up our game. A graphic designer or photographer that decided to resist learning Photoshop  and opposed its use in their profession is probably out of work now.
