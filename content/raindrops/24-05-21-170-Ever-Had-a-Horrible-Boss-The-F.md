# Ever Had a Horrible Boss? ‘The Fund’ Is the Perfect Rage-Read.

**URL:** https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/books/review/the-fund-rob-copeland.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare
**Type:** article

**Excerpt:** In Rob Copeland’s “The Fund,” we learn about the notorious hedge-fund giant Ray Dalio — and the manipulative professional hellscape over which he has presided.

**Notes:**
Reading this book right now. It is super good, highly readable. And you really learn about how weird a place to work can be.  You’ve got to read it to believe it. I don’t want to say more lest I get sued.
