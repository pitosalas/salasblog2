# Marp: Markdown Presentation Ecosystem

**URL:** https://marp.app/
**Type:** link
**Domain:** marp.app

**Excerpt:** Marp (also known as the Markdown Presentation Ecosystem) provides an intuitive experience for creating beautiful slide decks. You only have to focus on writing your story in a Markdown document.

**Notes:**
Another tool to turn markdown into html and css. This is FYI. So far I am still looking.
