**Notes:**
I admit I get confused by the various packages in this family of related low or no JavaScript goodies released by DHH. Hotwire, Stimulus, Hotwire Stimulus (something different, I guess). Some come with rails, some compete with each other. No matter, I love them all. I love the idea of not having to write and debug JavaScript. Hereâ€™s an article with code that shows a great use case.
