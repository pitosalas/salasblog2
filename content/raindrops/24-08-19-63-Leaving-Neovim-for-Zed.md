# Leaving Neovim for Zed

**URL:** https://stevedylan.dev/posts/leaving-neovim-for-zed/

**Excerpt:** A journey through text editors and how I landed on Zed after years of Neovim

**Notes:**
Linked is an article about Zed, a new programmers editor, trying to take the place of vscode. I love articles like this because they follow the kind of crazed thought process that I often have: is there something better than what I am using now?
