# Always Measure One Level Deeper | July 2018 | Communications of the ACM

**URL:** https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/7/229031-always-measure-one-level-deeper/fulltext

**Notes:**
Measuring performance is not necessarily obvious. One of the very common mistakes I have seen with students is worrying about performance before they know they have a problem. Most likely this comes from drumming Big-O notation and complexity into them!
