# Jade Rubick - Don’t use goal frameworks to manage projects

**URL:** https://www.rubick.com/advice-for-using-goal-frameworks/?utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Don%27t%20use%20goal%20frameworks%20to%20manage%20projects%20-%204537177

**Excerpt:** Goal frameworks like OKRs are a popular way to coordinate the work across an organization. One of the most common anti-patterns is to use it to run projects in engineering. This describes why that is a problem and better alternatives.

**Notes:**
Interesting views on various schemes for thinking about goal setting (often including measuring success at meeting them). One that I’ve heard of before is “commander’s intent” which is a succinct way to bring the “commander”s (in business this would probably be the person two levels up, or perhaps the department manager or similar) intent into the conversation.
