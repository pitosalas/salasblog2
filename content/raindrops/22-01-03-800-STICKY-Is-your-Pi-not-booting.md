excerpt: If you are reading this, you are presumably having trouble getting your Raspberry
  Pi or Pi 2, PI3(+) or PI4B to boot. This post will talk you through the potential
  causes of your boot problems, and will offer some solutions. If you use the PI3B+,
  note that it will only boot past the "rainbow screen" if you feed it the right (latest)
  boot files. So in case of trouble try using the latest Raspbian from the download
  page, or try updating your older software on an earlier PI on which it boots, with
  Raspbian that should work. If not ask the people behind the software for a compatible
  version.
