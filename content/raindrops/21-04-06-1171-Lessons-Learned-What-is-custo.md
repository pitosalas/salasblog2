  about customers, marketing, positioning, or PR, we delegate it to "marketroids"
  or "suits." Many of us are not accustomed to thinking about markets or customers
  in a disciplined way. We know some products succeed and others fail, but the reasons
  are complex and the unpredictable. We're easily convinced by the argument that all
  we need to do is "build it and they will come." And when they don't come, well,
  we just try, try, again.
