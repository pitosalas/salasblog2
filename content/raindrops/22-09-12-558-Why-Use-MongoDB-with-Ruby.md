**Excerpt:** I haven't read this yet, but the topic is of great interest: "Before discovering Ruby and Ruby on Rails I was a .NET developer. At that time I’d make ad-hoc changes to my development database, export my table/function/stored procedure/view definitions to text files and check them into source control with any code changes. Using diff functionality I’d compare the schema changes that the DBAs needed to apply to production and we’d script that out separately."
