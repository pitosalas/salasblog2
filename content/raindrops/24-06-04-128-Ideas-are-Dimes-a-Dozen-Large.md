I often say that ideas are cheap. And by that I mean that everyone has a million decent ideas. The art/trick/skill is to know how to turn that one idea into something that people want, use, benefit from,  and maybe are willing to pay for. That's why I don't often worry about "who had that idea originally" (and that includes me) but am more impressed with "who was able to execute successfully around that idea". And so, I don't doubt (from personal experience) that LLMs now and more so every day, will accelerate finding, sorting through, testing and challenging, ideas that lead to startups that work. Here's a paper on that very question.
