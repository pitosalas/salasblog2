# A stop/start/continue for the ungrading community

**URL:** https://rtalbert.org/a-stop-start-continue-for-the-ungrading-community/?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=campaign_7146472_nl_Teaching_date_20230629&cid=te&source=&sourceid=

**Notes:**
I am looking into the idea of ungrading or other alternative ways of dealing with assessment and grading. So expect to see more links along those lines!
