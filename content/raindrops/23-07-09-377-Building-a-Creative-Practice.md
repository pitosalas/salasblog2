# Building a Creative Practice

**URL:** https://open.substack.com/pub/biblioracle/p/building-a-creative-practice?r=1slq0e&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post
**Type:** article
**Domain:** open.substack.com

**Excerpt:** Could it even be the key to longevity?

**Notes:**
I think generative AI tools such as DALL-E and MidJourney for images and ChatGPT for text have scrambled people’s brains a bit. What the AI is capable of, and the way it presents its output to us is genuinely amazing and it’ll mess you up when you first see it.
