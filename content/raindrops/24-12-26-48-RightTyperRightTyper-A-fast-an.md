# RightTyper/RightTyper: A fast and efficient type assistant for Python, including tensor shape inference

**URL:** https://github.com/RightTyper/RightTyper
**Type:** link
**Domain:** github.com

**Excerpt:** A fast and efficient type assistant for Python, including tensor shape inference - RightTyper/RightTyper

**Notes:**
Linked is Python RIghtTyper which sounds great... if it works. It will analyze the type hints in your python (if any) and offers to gerentate them for you. Something like that. Many ways in which that might not go right but I read a very positive overview of it!
