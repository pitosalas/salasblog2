# The PhD Paradox: A Journey into Academia’s Upside-Down World – Daniel Lemire's blog

**URL:** https://lemire.me/blog/2024/09/11/the-phd-paradox-a-journey-into-academias-upside-down-world/

**Excerpt:** An ironic and cynical view of higher education’s obsession with degrees

**Notes:**
The linked article critiques the role of doctorates (PhDs) in higher ed and society as a whole. Key quote: “Imagine if we recruited professors not just for their academic credentials but for their real-world achievements. People who’ve actually built things that work, could revolutionize how we teach software engineering or entrepreneurship.” . Duh.
