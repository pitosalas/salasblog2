excerpt: We live in a busy world and can save time and effort by using the ls command
  when we need to look for files and data. But without a lot of tweaking, the default
  ls output isn't quite soothing to the eyes. Why spend your time squinting at black
  and white text when you have an alternative in exa? Exa is a modern-day replacement
  for the regular ls command, and it makes life easier. The tool is written in Rust,
  which is known for its parallelism and safety.
