# Zed - Code at the speed of thought

**URL:** https://zed.dev/

**Excerpt:** Just to prove that theres never the last word on anything, especially programmers editors. I thought history ended with vscode. But take a look st this, pretty tantilizing! Author says: “Code at the speed of thought. Zed is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter.”

**Notes:**
A very interesting new text editor. Looks a lot like vscode. Playing with it. It is *written in RUST* which is always now the key to being a cool app. It is very very fast. But it does not have all the plugins I rely on.
