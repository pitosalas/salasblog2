# When to use “raise from None” in Python

**URL:** https://www.bugsink.com/blog/using-raise-from-none-in-python/

**Excerpt:** Learn when and why to use Python's 'raise ... from None' to simplify stacktraces by hiding redundant exception context. Improve debugging clarity by focusing on the actual issue.

**Notes:**
Linked is a good article about raising exceptions in python. For me it also showed me some interesting “advanced” (or is it idiomatic) python.
