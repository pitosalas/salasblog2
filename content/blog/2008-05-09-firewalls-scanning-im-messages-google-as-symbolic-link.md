Here’s something I **hadn’t seen before:** I IM’d a friend of mine at a Big Company and the message got **rejected** because it included a **URL**. I have to suppose that it’s any URL that gets bounced, but who knows?
So the **workaround**? I sent the text for a **Google** query that returns the same url.

Further details: Discussing it with him, the logic seems to be that someone could send an employee a phishing link in an IM message.
