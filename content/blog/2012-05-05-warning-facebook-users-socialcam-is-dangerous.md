On Facebook you may see something like “George Harrison is **watching a video on Socialcam**” followed by a video.

Beware because if you watch that video by clicking on it, ALL your friends will now see that you watched it too.

On two occasions in the last few weeks, some pretty **embarassing** videos were watched by otherwise highly **respectable** people. **Funny**.
