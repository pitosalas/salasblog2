[Crystal is not Ruby Pt. 2 – Runtime Revolution](https://revs.runtime-revolution.com/crystal-is-not-ruby-pt-2-7c3d988aa9a1) 

Ive been playing around a lot with Crystal. If you’re a ruby person you will really like this for it’s compiled binaries. The typing is a big of a mixed bag but overall I think its helpful.
