[Kottke points to an ](http://www.kottke.org/06/11/rope-burning-logic-problem)amusing set of logic questions posted by  “3 Quarks Daily” with the (silly – you’ll see why) suggestion that it might make good dinner table conversation this Thanksgiving (in the US , of course 🙂 
I won’t repeat Kottke’s quote of the Rope Burning Question, but you should [check it out](http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/2006/11/i_challenge_you.html). The scenario is about two ropes which burn at different rates, but take always take exactly an hour, and you have a lighter. It ends with: “Now you are asked to measure a period of 45 minutes. How will you do it?”

I thought about it for about 60 seconds. Clearly the answer is: “I use a stopwatch.”

I don’t think that’s the answer that Kottke or Abbas Raza had in mind, but that’s the kind of crowd that sits around my table… You?
