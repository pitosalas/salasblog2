Apparently (not sure why yet) on Android, sound effects files using the OGG format work better than those using wav or mp3. It might be an AndEngine thing, I am not sure. Anyway, hereâ€™s my result of half hour googling and experimenting for a reliable way to convert the files. I tried a bunch of things, and I finally settled on [MediaHuman AudioConverter.](http://www.mediahuman.com/?app=mhac&ver=1.2) Use it. It really works and is nice and simple.
