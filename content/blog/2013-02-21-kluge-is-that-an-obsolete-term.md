I was amazed today when in a group of 25 undergraduate engineering students, only three had heard the word [kluge](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kluge). When I explained what it was, it still did not ring a bell. When I asked how they refer to an ugly, clunky, scotch-taped solution, inelegant and embarrassing, but which basically works, they came up with “hack”.

Query: Is the word “[kluge](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kluge)” becoming obsolete among the geek community?
