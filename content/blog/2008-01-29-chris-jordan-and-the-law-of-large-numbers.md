I saw [Chris Jordan](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chrisjordan.com%2F&ei=EKKcR7WlIJPKepSRhc4G&usg=AFQjCNFGf4SI90ATmYc6Xx9Cz5ZOSouKkA&sig2=99ucWmQTtXjJULFzz83etg) speak at [Pop!Tech](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.poptech.com%2F&ei=KaKcR6m6HIecerfC6M0G&usg=AFQjCNG1kyTh9YKJ5iHfPozGsbKjtOeiHQ&sig2=ROColInv6JLN4P83saeIdA) last year. Very interesting and impressive. These are huge photo shopped images that have kind of a macro/micro structure, so you see one image and then when you zoom waaaay in you see what itâ€™s actually represents.
Take a look at [this cool animated feature from Portfolio Magazine.](http://www.portfolio.com/interactive-features/2007/12/running-the-numbers)
