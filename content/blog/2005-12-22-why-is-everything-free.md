Have you noticed how man how many new apps that have appeared of late are available **free of charge**?

Web 2.0 services like [gada.be](http://gada.be/) or [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) or [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/). And more conventional client apps like [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/)?  The list is approximately infinite. They **come and **go at an amazing rate. And they are all **free**.

Not only are they free, **users** seem to *expect *them to be free. I am **not sure** how this came to be…

Is it a **unintended consequence** of the open source philosophy? Is it a **incorrect reframing** of the fact that major and well known services like google and yahoo are (**apparently**) free (although ad supported?)

Whatever the reason, I worry about the **chilling effect** this can have on innovation in our industry. 

**How many** great new innovations have **died on the vine** because there was just no way for the creators to **pay the rent** while building the **Next Big Thing**? Even after a year, two years of development, the **prospects** for getting users to somehow compensate for the value delivered were small to **none**. 

Is there **another** explanation? 

What if this was a pure **supply-demand** invisible hand phenomenon? What if the **platforms** on which these systems are built (Apache, Tomcat, PHP, MYSql, Java, and so on) have become so rich and so **powerful** that it has become *comparatively* very **cheap** to build wonderful innovative systems like [Furl](http://www.furl.net/), [Rollyo](http://rollyo.com/index.html) or [Reddit](http://reddit.com/), and therefore the market was valuing them correctly at zero dollars. (My friend [Shimon Rura](http://frassle.rura.org/Directory/index?feed=1) put forth a case along those lines the other day. )

While there’s an **element of truth** in this second explanation, I believe it is only a small part of the story. I continue to believe that this tendency to expect stuff to be free has had a chilling effect on innovation in our industry.
