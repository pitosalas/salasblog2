There’s been some back and forth silliness about whether Barack Obama can keep his Blackberry. All the pundits said “no way” but I thought, geez, the guy is President (did you hear?) all he has to do is say: ‘make it so’:
> “On Monday, a government agency that the Obama administration  — but
that is probably the National Security Agency — added to a standard
blackberry a super-encryption package…. and Obama WILL be able to use
it … still for routine and personal messages.” (from [Marc Ambinder in ](http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/01/obama_will_get_his_blackberry.php)Atlantic)

But, he won’t be allowed to use IM 🙂
