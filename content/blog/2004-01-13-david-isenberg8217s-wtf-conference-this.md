**[David Isenberg’s WTF Conference](http://www.isen.com/blog/archives/2004_01_01_archive.html):** This is from David’s newsletter, [SMART Letter](http://isen.com/):

> 
*…. Here’s the idea — an instant, bottom-up meeting. WTF.  Let’s get together face to face. Let’s talk about the end of telephony and the beginning of communication, about the end-to-end principle and its enemies, about smart people and dumb companies, intellectual property and creative commons, digital democracy and info-surveillance, e-commerce and the war against customers, and whatever else is on our minds. Let’s get to know each other, learn from each other, exchange ideas, frustrations, tools, toys and hacks. And let’s see what happens from there. WTF — it’ll be lots more exciting than talking corporate heads behind podiums…..*

[David](http://www.isen.com/blog/), count me **IN!**
