Came across this [interesting article](http://harpers.org/archive/2007/12/hbc-90001917). You may agree or not, but it’s definitely interesting:
> “So now the process can be fully diagrammed, and the cast of characters is stunning. The torture system involves the operations division of the CIA on the implementation side. They rely heavily on contractors, it seems, in torturing people. And a special role is apparently played by a couple of psychologists. (**from** [Harper’s Magazine](http://harpers.org/archive/2007/12/hbc-90001917))

p.s. Happy Valentine’s Day 🙂
