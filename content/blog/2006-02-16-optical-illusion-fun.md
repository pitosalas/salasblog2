I got this in an email, not sure exactly where it came from but it’s pretty cool. The image  looks like it’s moving, doesn’t it? But actually it’s not an animation at all. It’s your brain that getting its circuits scrambled. You know how you can tell? Just cover most of the image with your hands and look at a small part. It doesn’t move. Amusing!
