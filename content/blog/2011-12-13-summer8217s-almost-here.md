I noticed yesterday that sunset is now occurring at 4:12pm. The day before it was 4:11pm. So **sunset is getting later!** **Summer** is almost here, right?

p.s. Before some **smart-alec **points it out, yes I know that sunrise is still getting later so the **number of daylight hours are still shrinking. **

****It is left as an exercise to the reader to explain why the two events do not occur on the same day – in other words, sunset starts getting later several weeks before sunrise starts getting earlier. Note: the explanation is very complicated.
