Amazing idea from Scott Adams. Dilbert Mashups. Check this post [What’s Your Best Dilbert Punch Line?](http://mashable.com/2008/04/21/dilbert-mashups/) from [Mashable!](http://feeds.feedburner.com/mashable):

One drawback, though, is the fact that you can only create a mashup for the current day’s comic strip.” Check it out!
