This is an **interim report** on “Life with a [Capresso espresso maker](http://www.capresso.com/prod_esp_ultima.html)“. The topic for today is what kind of grind of coffee to use. Note that my experience is now about 3 or 4 days so you are learning right along with me.

**Basic** lesson, although I haven’t fully debugged it yet: **too fine** a grind ends up blocking the hot water totally, meaning no coffee comes out. (By the way, I am **not exactly sure** yet whether the water is literally blocked or is getting diverted into some waste reservoir.)

The [Capresso](http://www.capresso.com/prod_esp_ultima.html) which I bought from [WholeLatteLove](http://www.wholelattelove.com/) (**best** price, **free** shipping) came with a free pound of coffee beans. Being perhaps a little **too clever**, I asked my neighborhood [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.com/) to grind it for me. I **believe** the ground it too fine, and so I’ve had several batches of  non-coffee – that is, the machine makes all the right sounds, but nothing comes out.

As I mentioned in [my previous post](/weblogs/archives/001144.php), the [Capresso Ultima](http://www.capresso.com/prod_esp_ultima.html) has a rather **clever** way of ‘tamping’ the coffee which uses a lever (and so muscle power) but in a way that’s simple and fool proof. 

Well **almost**. The only thing that’s not exactly clear is how hard to push the lever down. Not too **hard**. Not too **soft**. So when **no coffee** comes out of the nozzle I am left with the **question**: was the grind too fine, or did I press too hard, or both? 

I will let you know as I learn more.
