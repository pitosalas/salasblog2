[ rails/docked: Running Rails from Docker for easy start to development]( https://github.com/rails/docked?utm_campaign=Ruby%20Radar&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) –This is not a new thing by a long shot. But thw fact that it is published by dhh is a big deal imo. For me it assures me to some extent that it is “correct” and that it will be maintained.
