I’ve been doing quite a bit of traveling lately and have been experimenting with those noise cancelling headphones. Actually I couldn’t convince myself to spend $350 on the Bose headphones who, by reputation anyway, set the standard.
I spent about $50 on a pair of Sony noise canceling headphones (at RadioShack no less.) My assessment: I give them a solid “B”. They do cancel noise, but not all of it. And having nothing to compare themm with, I am always wondering how much better the better ones are.

So, today, in David Poque’s column in the New York Times comes this article: [“Headphones to Shut out the World”](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/technology/14pogue.html?_r=1&ref=technology&oref=slogin) in which he gives a nice comparison of the many options out there and even recommends a pair of far less expensive ones:

> “So what’s the verdict? Nobody has yet knocked Bose off its pedestal, but Panasonic and Audio-Technica have climbed up there with it. These headphones sound amazing, but cost a half or a third as much.” (from [“Headphones to Shut out the World”](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/technology/14pogue.html?_r=1&ref=technology&oref=slogin))

David’s personal blog talks about the responses he’s already gotten from his readers in “[Blocking Out Background Noise”.](http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/blocking-out-background-noise/)a where readers recommend el-cheapo (yes, I do speak Spanish) ear protection as a viable alternative:

> “As another reader put it: “”I have a Bose QuietComfort 2 headset which transforms my daily
commute into almost a recreational activity. But I’ve found a better
solution: Get a pair of lightweight, industrial hearing protection ear
muffs for no more than $20 by Bilsom. (I love these: [http://tinyurl.com/2r4a6y](http://tinyurl.com/2r4a6y)).”

Interesting. That’s a cool idea, perhaps worth trying. I bet the Bilsom will last longer than even the Bose. But it’s kind of big and ugly, don’t ya think?
