I guess because **deep down** I am still a paranoid **Windows** user, my OS X  is configured to **automatically reboot** every Saturday at 7:00am, “*just to clear out the cobwebs*.” A very **handy** setting by the way, which I wish that Windows XP also had.

Am I **imagining** this?

Last week I turned off my Mac – turned off the power – because I was going to be away for a week. When I returned I found that it seems to have rebooted itself on Saturday as it does every Saturday. Can this be? **It was off! **I dunno, maybe I just imagined having powered it off a week ago…
