> Tor is a [sophisticated privacy tool](http://tor.eff.org/overview.html.en) designed to prevent tracking of where a web user surfs on the internet and with whom a user communicates. It’s endorsed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other civil liberties groups as a method for whistleblowers and human-rights workers to communicate with journalists, among other uses.

Read the article, it’s a fascinating look into the world of security.
