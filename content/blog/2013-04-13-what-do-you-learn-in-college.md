As you know the topic of the future of the university, the role of MOOCs, and online learning, is highly topical these days. I happen to be interested in it too so I refer you to this [David Brooks Article, called, The Practical University](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/opinion/Brooks-The-Practical-University.html). It’s an interesting angle.

However I want to pull a single quote out of that:

> 
“Think about Sheryl Sandberg’s recent book, “Lean In.” Put aside the debate about the challenges facing women in society. Focus on the tasks she describes as being important for anybody who wants to rise in this economy: ***the ability to be assertive in a meeting; to disagree pleasantly; to know when to interrupt and when not to; to understand the flow of discussion and how to change people’s minds; to attract mentors; to understand situations; to discern what can change and what can’t.” ***(**from** [New York Times – The Practical University](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/opinion/Brooks-The-Practical-University.html))

I don’t know if that’s David Brooks or Sheryl Sandberg speaking, but it does make we want to read her book. Anyway, watch how I turn this post into something about [Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu) 🙂

Why is it so important (in my opinion) that college students get lots of experience working in teams from the start? Because indeed it teaches them exactly ***those skills in italics above.*** And they are indeed very important skills. And don’t assume that these skills and experiences are commonplace across colleges. In my experience this is one of the major differences of how Olin approaches its mission.
