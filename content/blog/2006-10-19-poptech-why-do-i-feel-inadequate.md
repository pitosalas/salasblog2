Ok, [Pop!Tech](http://onsite.poptech.org/) is a wonderful conference, already, and I am learning and stimulated and all that. 
But why, oh why, is everyone an author, thinker, serial entrepreneur, extraordinary, world renowned, and inimitable? Inventor, artist, composer, musician, educator, philosopher. 

And these are not the speakers, these are the people sitting next to me and in line with me in the bathroom. Yikes!
