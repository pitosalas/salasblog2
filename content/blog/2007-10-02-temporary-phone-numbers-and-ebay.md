When you are selling or buying something on the web, say eBay or Craigslist, it always is a question whether to give your ‘real’ phone number out. I just came across Numbr.com (credit [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/software/privacy/get-a-free-disposable-phone-number-with-numbr-270222.php), and several others) which appears to have a neat solution to this. 
Simply, it gets you (for free, but doesn’t everything have to be free nowadays?) a temporary phone number which will anonymously forward calls to your real number. Simple and useful. Check out [Numbr.com.](http://numbr.com/)
