I was glad to see that the [FireFox add-in for del.icio.us](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3615/) was revised to combine the [features](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3615/history/) of the ‘old one’ with the features of the ‘new one’. That’s good. Unfortunately it looks to me like the new and improved plug-in is still a bit buggy, sending FireFox into a tailspin – window activation weirdnesses, apparent loops hogging the CPU. I look forward to the next rev, because the concept is right on.
