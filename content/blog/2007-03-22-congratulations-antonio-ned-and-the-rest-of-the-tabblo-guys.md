I just stumbled (get it?) across this:
> “Hewlett-Packard announced Thursday that it plans to acquire start-up Tabblo, citing an interest in the photo-sharing site’s technology that facilitates printing from the Web.” (from [C|Net News)](http://news.com.com/2100-1038_3-6169670.html?part=rss&tag=2547-1023_3-0-5&subj=news)

Nice going guys!
