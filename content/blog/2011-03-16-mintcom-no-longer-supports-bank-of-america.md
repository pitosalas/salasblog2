It’s **hard to believe**, but here is what I got from Mint.com when I asked why my Bank of America info was not updating on Mint:

Hi Pito,

Thank you for contacting Mint.com.

According to our engineers, we **can’t support Bank of America** due to unsupported authentication and/or challenge question format. We are, unfortunately, able to support the addition of products from that account at this time.

We apologize for the inconvenience and we appreciate your patience in this regard.

Have a nice day!

Thank you,
Naddy L.
Mint.com

So, **Mint.com no longer  supprts Bank of America accounts**. Isn’t Bank of America one of the biggest (or THE biggest US bank?)

I am most certainly not having a nice day. Time to move on from Mint.com.
