A little while back I mentioned [wis.dm](http://wis.dm/), a site that I’ve been helping with for about the last year. Rafe Needleman refers to it as a **“Social Network of Ideas”**

“This is a new web 2.0 business aiming to change the perceptions of social networking – how? – by encouraging **original** thinking, **creative** collaboration and innovative self promotion.” in [Martin’s words](http://www.mitforumcambridge.org/ww07/speakers.html), who started the whole thing.  

Or, from their team blog, a more catchy bit:

> *“…Finally, Zarathustra joyfully mused, I am free from the dull-eyed prisons of other social networking sites. It is not the HunyBaby123 or the Raiders_Fan1986 I seek. 

Companions, the ****creator**** seeks, not corpses, not herds and believers. I seek those who write new values on new tablets, and new tags on new ideas. 

Zarathustra rose from his bed and logged onto wis.dm. 

The future was looking bright…”* (**from** [wis.dm team blog](http://wis.dm/browse/14482))

Just the other day Rafe Needleman wrote a [kind summary](http://www.webware.com/8301-1_109-9686596-2.html?tag=blog) of what we’ve built:

> “At the [MIT Enterprise Forum event](http://www.mitforumcambridge.org/ww07/overview.html) last week, I talked to the founders of **[Wis.dm](http://wis.dm/)**, a new site that’s a blend of social bookmarking and social networking. I’d call it a social network for ideas. I like it a lot.” (**from** [WebWare](http://www.webware.com/8301-1_109-9686596-2.html?tag=blog))
