I just came across this announcement for the [‘Battle of the Tech Bands’](http://www.xconomy.com/2007/12/04/xconomys-battle-of-the-tech-bands/) on January 22 in Central Square (Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.)
“Musicians from Boston’s tech and tech-investment companies play their geeky hearts out—you pick the winners!”

Sounds like fun! [Check out the Battle of the Tech Bands here!](http://www.xconomy.com/2007/12/04/xconomys-battle-of-the-tech-bands/)
