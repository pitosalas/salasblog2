Pricing software is a perennial challenge. I came across this ebook, [“Don’t just roll the dice” by Neil Davidson.](http://www.neildavidson.com/dontjustrollthedice.html) It’s a very nice introduction to a tricky topic. I am considering a major revamp of the [BlogBridge](http://www.blogbridge.com) web site, with pricing and feature changes and this guide helps me think through those questions.
