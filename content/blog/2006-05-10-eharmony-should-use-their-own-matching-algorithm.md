This just struck me ironic because I just finished reading an interesting article in [The Atlantic about eHarmony ](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200603/online-love)and their scientific techniques for finding your perfect match.

In [Venture Chronicles](http://jeffnolan.com/wp/2006/05/10/eharmony-appoints-third-ceo-this-year/), a pointer to [Silicon Beat](http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2006/05/09/whats_up_at_eharmony_appoints_third_ceo_this_year.html): “eHarmony appoints third CEO this year.”; (And, no Brian, I didn’t independently verify the factualness of this 🙂
