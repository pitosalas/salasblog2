I guess it’s not surprising that people’s [Facebook and twitter accounts are getting compromised](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/technology/internet/14virus.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper). From the New York Times:
**“Malicious programs are rampaging through Web sites like [Facebook](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/facebook_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org) and [Twitter](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/twitter/index.html?inline=nyt-org), spreading themselves by taking over people’s accounts and sending out messages to all of their friends and followers. The result is that people are inadvertently telling their co-workers and loved ones how to raise their I.Q.’s or make money instantly, or urging them to watch an awesome new video in which they star.” (from** [From Viral Crooks, Social Networks are Prime Targets](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/technology/internet/14virus.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper))

I just changed my three Twitter accounts, and Facebook accounts to use a “very hard” password. I suggest you consider doing it too 🙂
