If you work with software developers you’ll **appreciate** these two pieces by **Paul Graham**, author of [Hackers and Painters](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html), a book that I also **recommend** heartily. 

He always has **interesting** things to say:

> “I once claimed that nerds were unpopular in secondary school mainly because they had better things to do than work full-time at being popular. Some said I was just telling people what they wanted to hear. Well, I’m now about to do that in a spectacular way: I think **undergraduates are undervalued**.” (From “[Hiring is obsolete](http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html)“)

I also came across this [really excellent IT Conversations Podcast](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail188.html) of a speech he gave at the Open Source Convention (OSCON), which I also highly recommend (and it would be a good introduction to [IT Conversations](http://www.itconversations.com/index.html) and Podcasting if you were **looking for an excuse** 🙂
