**Wonderful Mars pictures? Unavailable! **I was looking around the [Mars Rover Web](http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html) site for some of those amazing pictures, and to my surprise they are now asking for a password to get into the [‘raw images’](http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/spirit.html) area. I’ve got to believe that this is not for security but because their server was getting totally beat up by people like me browsing around. 

**Hmm, maybe they should use some warez technology? **Here maybe for the first time is a very ligitimate, legal, and useful place where [Bit Torrent](http://www.bittorent.com/) and other clever file sharing technologies could be used as a force for good 🙂
