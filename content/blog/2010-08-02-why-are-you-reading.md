If you are a hardcore blog reader like I am, and like [BlogBridge fans](http://www.blogbridge.com) are, it’s worth giving a little thought to what this article is saying:
> “I read this and thrashed and spluttered like Yosemite Sam for a while before I admitted it: he’s right. It is a self-created problem, and I need to understand what makes me feel the need to consume the equivalent of a Carnegie library every day, instead of just finding a more efficient way to choke it down.” (from [43 Folders](http://www.43folders.com/2007/12/11/why-are-you-reading-all-news))

Read the whole article: it **challenges assumptions** about why we read (and write) our blogs so diligently.
