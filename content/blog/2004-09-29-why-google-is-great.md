I’ve written about this before, I think, but I am once again **pleasantly amazed **by Google. 
I momentarily blanked out on the name of the ‘other’ conservative blogger – other than [Glenn Reynolds (Instapundit)](http://www.instapundit.com/) that is. 

So I asked Google, [what sites are related to Instapundit?](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&q=related%3Ainstapundit) And here’s what it says. Number 2 on the list: [Andrew Sullivan.](http://www.andrewsullivan.com/) Yup, right answer! 

**Cool or what?**
