Last week I went to the monthly [“WebInno” – web innovators group – ](http://www.webinnovatorsgroup.com/)meeting at the Sonesta in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA). I am **quite impressed** with the attendance and the quality of the people presenting.
The gathering was quite crowded and the buzz was very loud, lots of dynamic discussions going on all over the place, people trading war stories and comparing products. It was **stimulating and fun,** and I plan to go next month again.

In the meanwhile, Don Dodge of Microsoft writes a post “[Boston Startup Events and Resources” with quite a schedule of upcoming tech events in the Boston area](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheNextBigThing/~3/266292175/boston-startup.html). I thought I was in the loop, but guess what, there’s something going on tonight in Waltham that I had never heard of, so I will be there too.

It’s the so-called [“Tech Tuesday”](http://function.masstlc.org/programs_new/event_single.cfm?eventid=823) event, organized by [Dan Bricklin](http://danbricklin.com/log/), apparently with the collaboration of the [mass technology leadership council](http://www.masstlc.org/eve/). In a break with convention and tradition, it is not a free event for non-members. I guess they have to keep the MTLC staffers employed 😉 Still it should be fun.

So for all you “Boston is cool but I wish I lived in silcon valley” types, I say, stop it already, there’s a lot lot going on here. You just have to look!
