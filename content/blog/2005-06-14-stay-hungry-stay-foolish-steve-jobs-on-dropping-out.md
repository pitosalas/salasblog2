I [came across](http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=152625&cid=12810404) what is supposed to be the transcript of a commencement speech given by Steve Jobs (my hero 🙂 on June 14th. It’s certainly resonates with me:

> “You’ve got to find what you love, and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work, and the only way to do great work is to love what you do. 

If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking, and don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it, and like any great relationship it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don’t settle.” (**from**[ “Steve Jobs in Praise of Dropping Out”](http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=152625&cid=12810404))

Great advice.
