[Pop!Tech](http://www.poptech.com/) is [one of my all time favorite conferences](/weblogs/archives/000264.html). So favorite that I bought a ticket for this year’s event way in advance. I have hit an insurmountable schedule problem and so I have to miss it this year. So, I have a ticket that I can’t use, they won’t refund (the X*&!@([#&!@#’s](mailto:#&!@#)) but I can transfer. And it is substantially cheaper than what they are charging now because of when I bought it. If you are interested please contact me directly by email.
