I like to come across music from my collection of CDs that I haven’t listened to in a while. Here’s what I do:

- I create a “Smart Playlist” called, for example, Folk – Unplayed

- The “match query” includes Genere is Folk and Play Count is 0

As I play this list, it gets continually shorter as each song is played and removed from the list. Riff on this technique – other genres? Played once only? etc. Neat.
