[Interesting article about the sale of DVDs](http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/9/forget-itunes-americans-still-love-to-buy-dvds) in Silicon Alley Insider:
> “Just a reality check on the video download/rental business: There
really isn’t one yet. At least not compared to good old-fashioned DVD
sales and rentals.” (from “[Forget iTunes: Americans still love to buy DVDs](http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/9/forget-itunes-americans-still-love-to-buy-dvds)“)

Interesting article. I wonder, what about music CDs?
