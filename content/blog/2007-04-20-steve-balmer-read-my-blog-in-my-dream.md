I’ve been setting up a new Windows Vista notebook over the last few days for use by a non technical user. What a **basket case**. What a disaster. And I am referring to Vista not the user 🙂
I’ve been mentally working on a blog post titled either “Has Microsoft Lost its mojo” or “Has Microsoft Jumped the shark”?

I have encountered multiple absolutely shockingly and incomprehensibly bad usability issues. I am making a mental list as I go along. Joel on Software found one and wrote about it extensively: [read about the design of the “Start menu” and what it takes to shut down a Vista computer.](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/11/21.html) But just to give you a taste, all the documentation calls that thing the “Start” menu, except the word “Start” doesn’t appear anywhere on or near the menu.

But as I say, that’s all material for another post.
