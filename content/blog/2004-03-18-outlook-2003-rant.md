**Outlook 2003 Rant. **What were those guys thinking? Don’t get me wrong, I am **not one of those Microsoft haters**. I love Microsoft. I admire their work. But in this instance, and one that affects me directly and daily, boy do **I feel let down**!

I’ve been using Outlook 2003 for a few months now. While it has some nice new features, the one feature I use the most and arguably the most important because of its prominence is so-called *‘Navigation Pane.’* Not to rub salt in the wound,** but, why, oh, why**

- Can’t I resize the ‘Favorite Folders’ panel? 
Can’t I hide the ‘All Mail Folders’ panel? 
Doesn’t the ‘All Mail Folders’ Panel preserve its collapse state? 
Can’t I look at my Tasks along side my Calendar like I could in Outlook XP? 
Can’t I make sure that the ‘Current View’ Panel doesn’t disappear?

I remember a few years ago speaking to a Microsoft friend of mine who was a Program Manager who said, of the old ‘Outlook Bar’ – “we know it stinks; **we are completely redesigning it!”** Yikes.

And now I have to **wait another 4 years** for the next ‘redesign’ 🙁

(I’ve been harboring this for a long time. It feels good to get it off my chest.)
