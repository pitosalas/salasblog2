Check out [this post](http://get.wis.dm/danielsalas/?p=56) from [Saint 
 John the Conqueror](http://get.wis.dm/danielsalas):

> Much like when your TiVo “suggests” something uncomfortably 
 out-of-character, like The View when your queue is filled with nothing 
 but The Shield and The Sopranos, their bullseyes can leave you both 
 uneasy and confused. Once, the spread of ads to the side of my screen 
 contained nothing but links to drug rehab centers and alcoholism message 
 boards. Trying to tell me something, Google Ads? Nice try, Falwell, but 
 I don’t need the morality police wagging their fingers at me.
