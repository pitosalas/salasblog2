“We’re kickstarting a Super PAC big enough to make it possible to win a Congress committed to fundamental reform by 2016. We set fundraising goals and then crowdfund those goals.” 

Lofty goal but so vague I can’t tell which way is up!

I remember something that sounded similar, a few years ago: It was called[ Americans Elect.](http://www.salas.com/blog/2012/5/6/field-of-dreams-americans-elect.html) They had awesome goals, and they even got Thomas Friedman to endorse them. Like Lawrence Lessig. (See I don’t say “Larry” because we aren’t really on a first name basis 🙂 The problem is that Americans Elect failed miserably, and there was even some buzz that it was some kind of a front for less savory operators who I would not have supported if I had known them. I honestly don’t remember the details anymore but it did make me less willing to jump in an support positive but vague sounding causes.

So I am not ready to jump in with both feet into Mayday.Us.
