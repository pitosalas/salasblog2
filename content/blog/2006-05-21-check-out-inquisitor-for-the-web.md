I’ve [written](/weblogs/archives/000920.php) about a **very cool** Safari (Mac OS X) add-on called Inquisitor. **Very nice**.

Well, they now have come out with Inquisitor for the web, right in your web browser. [Try it out](http://www.inquisitorx.com/beta/), then I don’t need to explain it. Suffice it to say, it’s [verry cool](http://www.inquisitorx.com/beta/)!
