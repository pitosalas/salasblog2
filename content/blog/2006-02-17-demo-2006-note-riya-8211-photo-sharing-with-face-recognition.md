[This one was probably one of the most talked about sites](http://www.riya.com). The principle is, Flickr is nice, but no one really wants to take the time to tag. So instead, with Riya, after you upload your images, you can search for them based on who is in them and where they were taken. But the trick is that it uses image recognition to help you locate the pictures. Pretty impressive! [Check out Riya](http://www.riya.com).
