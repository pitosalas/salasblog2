**David Coursey’s back! **Well, I guess I may have been the last to notice. David wrote what was my favorite punditry column when he was at Anchordesk. Then he stopped, and I unsubscribed. Now via a pointer from Kevin W.’s blog I come to see [David’s back at it, and right there is his analysis of Social Networks](http://reviews-zdnet.com.com/AnchorDesk/4520-7297_16-5123850.html). How apropos!

David says that he’s been getting tons of LinkedIn invitiations and that he’s flattered, but he often doesn’t even remember the person. Oops. I will send him an email. Let’s see if he remembers me 🙂
