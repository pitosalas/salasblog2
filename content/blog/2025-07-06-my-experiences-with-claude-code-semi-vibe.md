title: My experiences with Claude Code - semi vibe
type: blog
---

All the code for this new version of my web site was written by claude code. Yes, I am not exagerating. Here are some of my take aways.

**Amazing** Yes, start with admiting that it is amazing. This is a fairly simple application but it has a fair number of moving parts. The code is all open source so you can see for yourself.

**Process** Basically I have two terminal windows open and vs code on the side. Terminal window 1 is running claude code. What that means is that I `cd` into the app directory and type `claude`. That's it (after installing claude of course. It starts up with kind of a "how can I help you" prompt, kind of like a doctor.

From then on you address it like you would a very fast junior programmer who usually understands what you want and does it. It has full access to your shell, your vscode buffers and your github, in real time. (Again once you have set it up.)

**What can you ask it to do**
