[SnapLogic](http://www.snaplogic.com) is an open source product (at least in it’s base edition) providing tools to construct pipelines that deliver and process and filter information through collections of interconnected REST services.
As usual, they provide a free ‘community’ edition, and then variously priced developer and enterprise editions. Pricing wasn’t indicated but if you have this kind of need, [SnapLogic](http://www.snaplogic.com) looks like it’s worth a peek.
