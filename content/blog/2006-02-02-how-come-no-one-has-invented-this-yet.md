I write a lot of emails and IMs with smileys  🙂 and big smileys 😀 in them. It’s very effective. But there’s one that keeps coming up for which for some reason there’s no correct emoticon, at least as far as I know…

I need an emoticon to denote a funny question. Haven’t you had that need 🙂 ?

See the problem? Is there one that exists or do we have to create a new one 😕
