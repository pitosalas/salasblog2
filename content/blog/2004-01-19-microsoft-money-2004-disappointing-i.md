**Microsoft Money 2004. Disappointing. **I started preparing my taxes and so I thought I might upgrade my Microsoft Money to the 2004 from 2003. I am a fairly comprehensive user of Microsoft Money, and so every year I do this, and frankly almost every year I am disappointed. 

**There are almost no new features**, enhancements, simplifications or whatever. **Am I a sucker?** Every year, I probably wait 2 to 3 months after the upgrade comes out to order it… I am well aware of their tack to extract yet another $50 from me (less the $20 rebate which) but I still fall for it, in the hope that even if nothing visible changes, bugs are fixed that will save me time even though I never am aware of it. Still I’d say if you are thinking of upgrading to 2004, you can **safely skip it.**
