I’m at the [O’Reilly Emerging Technology Conference](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/), aka “ETech”… really interesting. One ‘trick’ that just occurred to me is working well. When confronted with a series of sessions in the same time slot, instead of just going by the title of the talk, a quick google on the speaker is a great way to select which session to go to. 
For example, the next time slot has 5 presentations by people I didn’t know: [Gil Penchina](http://www.google.com/search?q=gil+penchina&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a), [Peter Biddle](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=7Df&q=peter+biddle&btnG=Search), [Richard Sprague](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=ZEf&q=richard+sprague&btnG=Search), [Simon Wardley](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=rFf&q=simon+wardley&btnG=Search) and [Adrian McDermott.](http://www.google.com/search?q=adrian+mcdermott&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a) (Yeah it’s my failing that I didn’t know you guys, if you find this post ego-surfing 🙂

But anyway, despite some very non-descriptive session titles, thanks to google, I now know what which one I want to go to.
