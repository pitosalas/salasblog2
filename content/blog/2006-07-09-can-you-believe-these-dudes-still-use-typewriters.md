A typewriter, you know: **a printer with a keyboard built right into it**? 

Anyway, I care little about the politics of this, but [check this letter out](http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20060709hoekstra.pdf), dated May 18, 2006 for **crying out loud**. Doesnâ€™t even look like an IBM Selectric ðŸ™‚

Ok, maybe Iâ€™m wrong? Is this a printer rigged with an **old typewriter font**? Nah I donâ€™t think so. **Carbon copies** anyone?
