There’s an amusing new blog I came across: [“Gapingvoid”, ](http://www.gapingvoid.com/)by Hugh Macleod. He’s a cartoonist, and his postings often have a quickly sketched amusing drawing. 
I caught [today’s posting ](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001151.html)with this quote on it: 

***‘ “I can’t take this shit anymore!” He said, mistakenly’ *

Amusing**.

From “Waiting for Godot”:

***ESTRAGON: I can’t go on like this.
VLADIMIR: That’s what you think.*

More amusing.**
