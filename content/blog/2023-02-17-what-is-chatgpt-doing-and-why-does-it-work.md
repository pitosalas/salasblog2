[ What Is ChatGPT Doing … and Why Does It Work?]( https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav) –This is a pretty amazing article. Even though it’s “non technical” and I read all of it, I think I only understood about 75%: “Stephen Wolfram explores the broader picture of what’s going on inside ChatGPT and why it produces meaningful text. Discusses models, training neural nets, embeddings, tokens, transformers, language syntax.”
