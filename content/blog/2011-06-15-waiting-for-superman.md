I recently saw the movie “Waiting for Superman” – yes I am late to the party. But in case you have not seen it let me recommend it to you as a highly revealing and disappointing view into the way the American school system runs, stuck in a system that feels so wrong in so many ways. Watch it. And visit the [Waiting For Superman Web Site.](http://www.waitingforsuperman.com)

Here is the IMdb info for [Waiting for Superman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1566648/). Here is the[ Netflix link for the DVD.](http://movies.netflix.com/Movie/Waiting-for-Superman/70129364#height2429)
