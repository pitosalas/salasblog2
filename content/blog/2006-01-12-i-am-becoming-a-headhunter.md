No, just kidding, I am **not. **Some of my best friends are headhunters and I wouldn’t want to compete with them.** 

But** I do **often** find out about people in my network who are **looking** for new positions and I try to **connect** them to those I know who are looking for new people. Recently another person emailed me saying they were looking for someone, and I realized that I might have lost track of what openings I know about.

So – to those of you who know me personally – if you are hiring, feel free to send me an email so I can keep an eye out and connect you to candidates.

*No, I don’t charge a fee 🙂*
