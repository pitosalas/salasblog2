I’ve been [tagged in the new fangled blog tag game](http://libraryclips.blogsome.com/2006/12/21/blog-tag-5-things-about-me/), and am now honor bound to reveal 5 things about me that you probably don’t know yet.

- The “R” in R. Pito Salas stands for Ralph
- My ancestors have been in Curaçao for over three hundred years
- I’ve been studying piano for 3 years. I am still a beginner.
- I was a team lead on one of the earliest Macintosh software products, Jazz

And now, it is for me to tag 5 others. It would be fun if there was a permanent home for these fun factoids about us.
