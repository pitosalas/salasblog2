More stuff that I learned at [Transparency camp](http://www.transparencycamp.org/).
Every city has their own way of talking. In New York, I guess you talk about wall street and finance and so on. In L.A. you talk about movies and moviestars. In D.C. you talk about all things politics. (In Boston you talk about the Red Sox 🙂

The President’s limousine, is known as “**The Beast**“

You’ve heard the expression: “It’s easier to apologize than to ask permission.” In DC it’s “**Proceed until apprehended**.”

You mark yourself as an out-of-towner if you don’t know what **CQ** stands for.
