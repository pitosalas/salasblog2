An interesting, quirky, though-provoking — memorable article in [Wired about Memory](http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-05/ff_wozniak?currentPage=all):
> “[snip…]SuperMemo is based on the insight that there is an ideal moment to practice what you’ve learned. Practice too soon and you waste your time. Practice too late and you’ve forgotten the material and have to relearn it. The right time to practice is just at the moment you’re about to forget.” (from [Want to Remember Everything You’ll Ever Learn?)](http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-05/ff_wozniak?currentPage=all)
