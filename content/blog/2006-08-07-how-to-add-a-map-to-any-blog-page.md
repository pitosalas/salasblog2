I came across this interesting bit in [LifeHacker: ](http://www.lifehacker.com) [WikiMapia – The geographical wikipedia – Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/google-maps/wikimapia--the-geographical-wikipedia-176634.php).
It teaches that using WikiMapia, you can **add a map** to any web page in 30 seconds. If that claim is true, then you should be seeing a map of where **I was born** below. If you don’t see that map, then ignore this post, please 🙂

p.s. **It worked!!!**Just shows that there’s nothing you can’t get from the internet, and that Google Maps is unbelievably cool!
