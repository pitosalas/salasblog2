[The Many Mysteries of Air Travel – NYTimes.com](http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/the-many-mysteries-of-air-travel/):

> If you’d like the answers, I highly recommend Patrick Smith’s new book, “Cockpit Confidential.” Mr. Smith is a pilot and blogger; much of the book’s format and contents are on display at his Web site, AskThePilot.com, or in the archives of the “Ask the Pilot” column he wrote for Salon.com for years.
