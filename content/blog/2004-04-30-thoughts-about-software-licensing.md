[Dan Bricklin’s written a bit on a topic that’s been indirectly on my mind lately](http://www.bricklin.com/licensingthinking.htm). It has to do with [BlogBridge](http://www.blogbridge.com), the Blogging tool that I’ve been developing as a back room project for a while now (I post periodic updates, so you might have seen them.) 
Anyway, the connection is that starting sometime next month when I wrap up my current consulting project I will be devoting more time on BlogBridge to see if I can’t get it to a real stable and usable form, and who knows, try to sell it? Progress has been accelerating lately – there’s another developer working on it part time now (Aleksey, in the Ukraine) and things are coming along nicely.

So in my future will be the question of a software license. Right now all the code is open source and the source in fact is all available free to anyone on SourceForge.net. I haven’t spent a whole lot of time thinking about it, but I think I can make sense out of having a commercial (“for pay”) license of the running, supported, tested and deployed version of an open source product. 

Coupled with the fact that BlogBridge will have a service component which will be hosted on www.blogbridge.com, which opens the door to a subscription model as well. I think you’ll like that when you hear about it 🙂

Anyway, I will write more about my plans as they evolve. For now, I just wanted to point to Dan’s interesting pieces.
