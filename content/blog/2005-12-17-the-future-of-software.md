Tim Bray [likes Adium, the Mac OS X inter-network IM client](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/12/16/Adium). He says:

> “Software of the future will be Open Source, will have a sophisticated and smart user interface, will take responsibility for making sure it’s up to date, and will meet essential human needs. Like Adium.” (**from** ongoing, [Tim Bray’s Blog](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/))

Hmm, [couldn’t agree with you more](http://www.blogbridge.com/) 😉
