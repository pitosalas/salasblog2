Unfortunately students can be quite focused on their grades, and as a result I end up paying more attention to grading than I would like. By the way let me point out that ‘grading’ is more than assigning a grade to a bit of homework. Without going into detail, you have to decide and communicate:

- What all the gradable items of work are (e.g. a programming assignment, a reading assignment, a test, a presentation, a mockup or prototype, etc. etc.)
- Your logical scheme for assigning a grade to a work item. That is, what is an “A” for a programming assignment? For a particular presentation, etc.)
- What the relative weighting is of each grade is
- What formula you use to convert all the individual work item grades to a final grade

And then when you are teaching you have to stick to what you decided and communicated because you can be sure someone will ask for an explanation. 

I just had a converation about this today with some students. So in this mindset I was amused / intereste to read this article:

[The most commonly awarded grade at Harvard is an A – Quartz](http://qz.com/153694/the-most-commonly-awarded-grade-at-harvard-is-an-a/):

> “The median grade in Harvard College is indeed an A-,” the school’s dean of education said today, according to the student newspaper. Even more stunning: “The most frequently awarded grade in Harvard College is actually a straight A.”

Now. Harvard will probably say, and maybe reasonably, that it’s so hard to get into Harvard that all the students deserve the grades they get because that’s just *how good they are!*
