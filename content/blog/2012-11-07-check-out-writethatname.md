I’ve been using a app called “[WriteThatName](https://writethat.name/live/webapp/en/settings.html?pin=1941955007.5125032531&o=7&t=en-en-v2-referrals-announce&v=0)” which very helpfully scans the emails I receive for signature blocks with people’s name. It takes that info and correctly parses it and adds it to my google contacts. Super nice. I [recommend](https://writethat.name/live/webapp/en/settings.html?pin=1941955007.5125032531&o=7&t=en-en-v2-referrals-announce&v=0) it!
