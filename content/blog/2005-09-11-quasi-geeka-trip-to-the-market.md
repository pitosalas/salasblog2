Do you follow [Ben Hyde’s blog](http://enthusiasm.cozy.org/)? I **recommend** it – he has always fascinating intellectual tours-de-force. 

I guess it was a slow day in the Hyde office when there were no world-changing problems to be addressed, so [check out this analysis](http://enthusiasm.cozy.org/archives/2005/08/trip-to-the-market/) of what it costs you to use  your car. 

Interesting, **relevant** in today’s $3.00+ per gallon world,  and (intentionally?) **funny** too!

(And someday I will be able to parse the sentence “Ascription is Anathema to any Enthusiasm 🙂
