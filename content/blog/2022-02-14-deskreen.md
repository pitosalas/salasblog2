[ Deskreen](https://deskreen.com/lang-en)
 Deskreen is a desktop app that turns any device with a web browser into a secondary screen for your computer over WiFi. Deskreen can be used to mirror entire computer display onto any device screen that has a web browser. Also you can limit Deskreen to select only one application window view to share – very useful for presentation purposes. The best feature of Deskreen is to use any device as a secondary screen. To have a true extended desktop experience Deskreen should be used with Virtual Display Adapter. Also with no need for Virtual Display Adapter you can have a teleprompter with Deskreen using your tablet or smartphone, for that Deskreen has Flip Screen Mode that mirrors computer screen in web browser of your tablet (aka. flip screen horizontally).
