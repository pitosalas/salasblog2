excerpt: Several million people employ electronic mail for some significant portion
  of their professional communications. Yet in my experience few people have figured
  out how to use the net productively. A great deal of effort is going into technical
  means for finding information on the net, but hardly anybody has been helping newcomers
  figure out where the net fits in the larger picture of their own careers. These
  notes are a first attempt to fill that gap, building on the most successful practices
  I've observed in my twenty years on the net. I will focus on the use of electronic
  communication in research communities, but the underlying principles will be applicable
  to many other communities as well.
