# Doing Stuff with AI: Opinionated Midyear Edition

**URL:** https://open.substack.com/pub/oneusefulthing/p/doing-stuff-with-ai-opinionated-midyear?r=1slq0e&utm_medium=ios
**Type:** article
**Domain:** open.substack.com

**Excerpt:** AI systems have gotten more capable and easier to use

**Notes:**
I think many technology savvy people are way underestimating the usefulness of large language models, LLMs, like ChatGPT, the best known LLM. But there are others. And they are improving and changing on a weekly basis. But my respect and admiration for their capabilities also makes me (helplessly) worry about how they WILL be used to cause serious harm in the future.  The attached article is a great run down of current capabilities of these systems.
