# Introducing the first alpha of Turso: The next evolution of SQLite

**URL:** https://turso.tech/blog/turso-the-next-evolution-of-sqlite?utm_source=tldrwebdev
**Type:** article
**Domain:** turso.tech

**Excerpt:** We’re launching the first alpha of Turso. A Rust-based, cloud-native rewrite of SQLite with modern concurrency, async APIs, and unmatched reliability powered by advanced testing and open-source collaboration.

**Notes:**
Linked is a new database - they come every day now don’t they? This ones claim to fame is that it’s an open source rewrite of SQLite allowing asynchronous API calls and concurrent access. It seems to follow the SQLite API exactly. It is a white box rewrite by a different team.
