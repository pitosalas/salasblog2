excerpt: The Panasonic FZ1000 II is a worthy successor to the company's first large-sensor,
  long-zoom bridge camera, and a value-conscious rival to the popular Sony RX10-series.
  It's just as fast as its predecessor but produces nicer JPEGs, has significantly
  improved controls and interface, and more.
