**Excerpt:** The emotional impact of interface colors shouldn’t be overlooked. And while some colors are “universal” in UI design (such as black, white, and gray, at least one of which is used in virtually every good design out there), the colors with which they’re combined can have a huge impact on a product’s UX.
