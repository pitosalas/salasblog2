![Wordpress Timestamp](https://i0.wp.com/s3.media.squarespace.com/production/1075723/12829350/wp-content/uploads/imagewell//timestamp.jpg?w=584)Have you noticed? How frequently I’ve been posting?
I am using WordPress’s ‘post in the future’ feature so in one sitting I can rattle off 6 or 7 posts  and schedule them for publication in the coming days.

Very efficient 🙂
