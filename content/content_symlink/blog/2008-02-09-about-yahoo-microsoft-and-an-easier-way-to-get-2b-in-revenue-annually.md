You can read all about the potential acquisition of Yahoo by Microsoft, here for example, where Marc Andreessen writes:
> “I think that a Microsoft/Yahoo merger would have practically no impact on any high-quality Silicon Valley startup.” (from [Silicon Valley after a Microsoft/Yahoo merger](http://blog.pmarca.com/2008/02/silicon-valley.html))

You should read his whole paper to get his 5 point argument. And I definitely agree with this conclusion:

> “Build something of value — something that people want, and something that will be profitable at the appropriate point — and the world is yours. [snip…]

Or, reduced to a phrase: *the best way to get bought is to not be for sale.*” (**from** [Silicon Valley after a Microsoft/Yahoo merger](http://blog.pmarca.com/2008/02/silicon-valley.html))

*Good stuff*, especially that last conclusion.

Personally, I am shorting both Microsoft AND Yahoo.

I predict that the ‘integration’ (a word used very loosely) will give both Microsoft and Yahoo a huge amount of indigestion because I think it’s basically not possible.

The expected ‘leverage’ and ‘reduction of duplication’ will actually be an extended period of executive and **strategic distraction**, **loss** of the best people at Yahoo, and in the end, **nothing**.

I think **Microsoft would do better** putting those $40+ Billion in the bank and get a nice $2,000 million revenue stream annually, forever.
