A lot has been written about [Siri (the new voice activated assistant in the iPhone 4s)](http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html). I have to say that it works surprisingly well. It has been **eerily accurate in properly transcribing my voice,** although not quite as perfect in understanding what I am saying.

I just had a 3 message dialog with someone over text messaging using Siri. I **never ever **would have done that with texting previously but here I went speaking in **complete sentences **over text messaging and with 100% accurate recognition. I donâ€™t know if the other guy was using Siri but if he wasnâ€™t he must have been annoyed by how quickly I responded with a full sentence ðŸ™‚

It occurs to me that the average length of text messages might become longer and longer with the advent of services like this. I wonder if that is at least part of the reason that Apple is now **bypassing** the mobile operators when doing iPhone to iPhone messaging.
