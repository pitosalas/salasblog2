As I mentioned a few days ago, I went to see “The Gates” – [Environmental art by Christo](http://christojeanneclaude.net/tg.html). My reaction: much better and cooler than I thought it would be. 
Not that there were any surprises – **it’s exactly what it was said to be**: a whole bunch of orange (oops, sorry, safron) rectangular ‘gates’ all over many of the paths and byways of Central Park in New York City. 

*
The **impact** of the scale of the project is perhaps what was the **surprise**. You stand one a path, under the canopy of one Gate – and for as far as your eye can follow the path, more and more gates. *

*

But then you look around you, and in the distance, almost along the horizon, more and more gates, everywhere*. It evokes the feeling of being part of a **huge parade** or **ceremony**. 

 Surprisingly powerful.

#### What’s the point of taking pictures?
 I had forgotten my camera and as I was walking around it occurred to me: [Flikr! Check this out!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/gates) There are over 4000 pictures, and that only under one tag.

Other than perhaps a picture with Me in it, I don’t think there’s any picture that I could have taken that is not already in [this collection!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/gates/show/)
