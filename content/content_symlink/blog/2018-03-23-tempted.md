I came across my old blog that I’ve not posted to in 3 years and, well, found some really good stuff. I recently dropped all social media because it had become a total time sync. Bit yeah, some really good stuff. Also WordPress is a very nice platform. It’s evolved right  under me and now it’s downright pleasant to use. Maybe… Should I start blogging again?
