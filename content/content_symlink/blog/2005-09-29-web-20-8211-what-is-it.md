Web 2.0 is one of those phrases that gets used and used and then [people](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/08/not_20.html) [go](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/08/04/Web-2.0) nuts because they realize that they are all talking about something different. It becomes a **heroic** fight of **personalities**, **emotion**, **politics**, **ego **and oh, a little technology. Haven’t we seen this with other terms (memes) on which **careers** got built? “open source”, “blog”, “journalism”? As usual, [Dave cuts through the crap](http://archive.scripting.com/2005/09/28#When:11:54:00PM) and figures out the way:[ “What if Web 2.0 is actually about sex?”](http://archive.scripting.com/2005/09/28#When:11:54:00PM) 😀
