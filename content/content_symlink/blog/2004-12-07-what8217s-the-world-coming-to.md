Someone just pointed [me to this item on Mike Zellers blog](http://www.mikezellers.com/archives/000627.html), under the title, “best explanation of election i can think of….” Just having taken a short Photoshop course and wanting to test my newly found chops, here’s a little something I cooked up:![](https://i0.wp.com/s3.media.squarespace.com/production/1075723/12829350/weblogs/archives/picture.jpg?resize=584%2C438)
Disclaimer: I don’t know Mike Zellers and his photograph is most likely totally legitimate. Not that my fake would fool anyone.
