# What About Static Typing in Ruby? – Noel Rappin Writes Here

**URL:** https://noelrappin.com/blog/2024/08/what-about-static-typing-in-ruby/
**Type:** article
**Domain:** noelrappin.com

**Excerpt:** I just write here

**Notes:**
Linked is a subtle and really interesting article about static vs dynamic typing. I’ve been a fan of python type hints and annoyed with how Ruby, so far has approached the political pressure to have an answer. For the first time for me, this article articulates how type hints may be great for sample code or fairly simple real code, but can become a burden for “real” code. I’ve experienced this myself but did not realize what was going on. He also builds an interesting distinction between type checking and data validation. Maybe Ruby needs an equivalent to pedantic?
