# The Case for Models | Concerning Quality

**URL:** https://concerningquality.com/models/
**Type:** link
**Domain:** concerningquality.com

**Excerpt:** An interesting idea, model based testing. The aurhor says: “Again, I’m writing about models because I have a deep desire to keep software minimal. While I don’t think it’s wrong to simply buckle up and deal with the complexity and raw magnitude of implementations as many of us do, that’s just not the path that I find appealing intuitively.”
