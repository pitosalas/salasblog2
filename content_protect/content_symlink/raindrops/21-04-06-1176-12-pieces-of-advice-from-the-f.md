excerpt: Ideas are worthless. Execute. No one wants to sign your NDA. No one cares
  that you think your idea is so special. Guess what? Any VC or well connected person
  in Silicon Valley will know 10 other people with the same idea, some of whom will
  be working on it. Talk to people. Get feedback. Improve your idea. Most importantly
  make it happen. That is where the value is - execute. "Vision without execution
  is just hallucination" Henry Ford knew what was up.
