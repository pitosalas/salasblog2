excerpt: Hi there!&nbsp; This webpage covers the space and time Big-O complexities
  of common algorithms used in Computer Science.&nbsp; When preparing for technical
  interviews in the past, I found myself spending hours crawling the internet putting
  together the best, average, and worst case complexities for search and sorting algorithms
  so that I wouldn't be stumped when asked about them.&nbsp; Over the last few years,
  I've interviewed at several Silicon Valley startups, and also some bigger companies,
  like Yahoo, eBay, LinkedIn, and Google, and each time that I prepared for an interview,
  I thought to msyelf "Why oh why hasn't someone created a nice Big-O cheat sheet?".&nbsp;
  So, to save all of you fine folks a ton of time, I went ahead and created one.&nbsp;
  Enjoy!
