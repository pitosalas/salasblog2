# Department of Justice versus The Future

**URL:** https://open.substack.com/pub/salsop/p/department-of-justice-versus-the?r=1slq0e&utm_medium=ios
**Type:** article
**Domain:** open.substack.com

**Excerpt:** If our government is concerned about protecting and enhancing competitive behavior, why has it chosen to sue Apple for choosing to do everything for its customers?

**Notes:**
Attached is an insightful article showing the craziness of the government using apple messenger as the basis for going after apple for anticompetitive behavior. Put in historical context, it makes no sense!
