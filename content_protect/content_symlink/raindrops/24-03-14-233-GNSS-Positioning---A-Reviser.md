# GNSS Positioning - A Reviser

**URL:** https://www.semuconsulting.com/gnsswiki/
**Type:** link
**Domain:** semuconsulting.com

**Excerpt:** This article reviews the core principles underpinning the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). It references some of the key terminology, outlines the main potential sources of error, and describes how the application of RTK DGPS techniques can mitigate these errors to a large extent.

**Notes:**
A super comprehensive introduction to GPS, with more detail than I have seen elsewhere. Also based on the second paragraph it seems to be quite up to date (2023)
