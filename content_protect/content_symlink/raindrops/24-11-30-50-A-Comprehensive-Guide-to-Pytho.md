# A Comprehensive Guide to Python Project Management and Packaging: Concepts Illustrated with uv – Part I – Reinforced Knowledge

**URL:** https://reinforcedknowledge.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-python-project-management-and-packaging-concepts-illustrated-with-uv-part-i/
**Type:** article
**Domain:** reinforcedknowledge.com

**Notes:**
Linked is a useful and comprehensive series about packaging in python. The fact that there are so many of these is evidence that, a) I am still confused about some of this, and b) the state of packaging in python is and remains a mess. I don’t know how we are going to get out of this?
