excerpt: Goal crafting is one of the most essential leadership activities. Organizational
  performance and team growth depend on well-crafted goals. Without a good goal-crafting
  exercise, your teams may focus on what is in front of their noses, solving what
  seems quickly solvable. Good goal crafting forces you not to ignore or postpone
  problems that require new ways of thinking, collaboration, or hardships. Without
  a good goal-crafting exercise, you can get stuck in the status quo or focus on what
  matters to you or your opinions, not what your stakeholders might need.
