# Lazy self-installing Python scripts with uv

**URL:** https://treyhunner.com/2024/12/lazy-self-installing-python-scripts-with-uv/
**Type:** article
**Domain:** treyhunner.com

**Excerpt:** I frequently find myself writing my own short command-line scripts in Python that help me with day-to-day tasks. It’s so easy to throw together …

**Notes:**
Linked is a good article; in particular I learnt how uv is going to support the functionality of pyenv.
