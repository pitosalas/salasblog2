# B-trees and database indexes â€” PlanetScale

**URL:** https://planetscale.com/blog/btrees-and-database-indexes?_bhlid=b6b2800f0ffeba1274ea67ac8876a128ccdb69cc
**Type:** article
**Domain:** planetscale.com

**Excerpt:** B-trees are used by many modern DBMSs. Learn how they work, how databases use them, and how your choice of primary key can affect index performance.

**Notes:**
Linked is a neat article explaining a lot about b-trees. Especially notable are the excellent visualization and animations which gave me a new way to understand these incredibly important data structures.
