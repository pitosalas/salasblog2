Just from today’s New York Times:

> 
“Voters in New York State use a vote-scanning system that can tally votes swiftly and, in most cases, correctly. Not New York City. The city’s Board of Elections uses a **creaky system of counting by hand** that is prone to **embarrassing errors **on election night.” (**from** [Why Can’t NYC Count Votes?](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/opinion/why-cant-new-york-city-count-votes.html))
