I like this quote:

“Everyone here introduces themselves as an “entrepreneur.” It’s as if they hand out the title at the airport when you arrive. “Welcome to San Francisco, you are now an entrepreneur! Which start-up T-shirt would you like?”

This belief that everyone is an entrepreneur has a stultifying effect. It can drive founders to seek an easy acquisition instead of a quest for true innovation and a sustainable, profitable business — a truly entrepreneurial challenge.” (**from** [Bits Blog, NYT](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/disruptions-looking-beyond-silicon-valleys-bubble/))
