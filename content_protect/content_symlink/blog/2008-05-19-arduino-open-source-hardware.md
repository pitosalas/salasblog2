Check out [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/), a totally cool tiny embedded computer suitable for creating smart things ‚Äì art, robotics, sensors and controllers. You program it on your laptop, and download the program to the device. I tried it, it was pretty easy. Had to touch wires and stuff though üôÇ
It appears to be a [vibrant community](http://groups.google.com/group/DorkbotBoston?hl=en) with lots of people building compatible boards as well as add-ons which they seem to call ‚ÄúShields‚Äù. For example here‚Äôs a [shield to allow wireless communication between two Arduinos](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoXbeeShield).

If you want to learn more, check out books called ‚Äú[Physical Computing‚Äù](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=physical+computing&x=0&y=0) and ‚Äú[Making things Talk‚Äù](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=physical+computing&x=0&y=0).
