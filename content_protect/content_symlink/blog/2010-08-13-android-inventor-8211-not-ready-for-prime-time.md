The other day I wrote a post where I [mentioned Google’s App Inventor](/2010/08/05/david-weinberger-has-flat-feet-programming/), and I mentioned it with some skepticism.
Today, a column in the [New York Times that covers Google’s App Inventor](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/technology/personaltech/12pogue.html) in more detail, and comes to more or less the same conclusion:

> “I’m happy for App Inventor. I wish it a long and exciting life. Surely it will have one in schools and computer classes, among other niches.

But for nonprogrammers on their own? Forget it. Android Hype Inventor is more like it.” (**from** [the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/technology/personaltech/12pogue.html))
