The idea is that you walk up to something, say the Eiffel Tower, or my house, point your cell phone camera at it and a click or so later, you get a nice article on the screen of your phone, describing it.

I first read about it in [Jeremy Wagstaff’s ‘Loose Wire’](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118607066711486214.html.html?mod=technology_main_promo_left) series.

Quirky, in a Don Quixote kind of way.
