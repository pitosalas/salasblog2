> “So yet another way you can help Ruby and Rails Activism is by attending
(supporting) a conference. Below you’ll find conferences coming up in
the next 6 months. If you think I’ve missed one, or if the information
is incorrect, please post a comment.” (from [Riding Rails](http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2009/1/28/ruby-rails-conferences))

If you look at the [list of conferences and meetings](http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2009/1/28/ruby-rails-conferences), all looking interesting, there’s nothing anywhere near Boston. Hey, whatup?
