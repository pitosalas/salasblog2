Have you ever heard a politician or pundit say, with self-assurance, America is a **Right of Center** country. Think [Newt Gingrich.](http://www.newt.org/)

Right of Center. **How** do we **determine** the center?

Isn’t this a lot like [Lake Wobegon](http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/), “Where **all** our children are **above average**“?

I’m just sayin’…
