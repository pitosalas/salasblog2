**Q.** Did you experience an “aha’’ teaching moment?

**A. **My first time teaching, I was using PowerPoint slides. One student kept saying, “I don’t see it.’’ So I turned off the computer, grabbed a piece of chalk, and went through the material slowly on the blackboard, without notes. Afterward, the kid said, “You’re a really good teacher when you’re not using PowerPoint.’’ That changed everything.” (**from** [The Boston Globe](http://articles.boston.com/2011-06-14/news/29657519_1_teaching-moment-computer-giggle))
