I just finished reading an **excellent** book called [Confessions of an Econmonic Hit Man](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=blogbridge-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1576753018%3Fv%3Dglance%26n%3D283155).Â  Quite **amazing** really. Tells about the **machinations** of american foreign aid, and how all foreign aid is not as **benevolent** as you might think. Also kind of hints at why there are so many Texas oil men and huge construction contractors represented in the **government**. A fascinating read. **Recommended**.
