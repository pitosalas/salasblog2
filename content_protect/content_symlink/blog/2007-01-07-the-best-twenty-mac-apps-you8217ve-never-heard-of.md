Some good mac applications referenced in [this 
post](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/mac-os-x/the-best-twenty-mac-apps-youve-never-heard-of-226658.php) . I particularly like Service Scrubber (never could really find a 
use for that Service menu, sorry!) and CocoaMySql which looks like a very 
nicely done graphical UI for MySql databases. Check out [this
