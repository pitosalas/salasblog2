[Peggy Noonan](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204731804574391153099885242.html) is always a favorite of mine. Here’s another good op-ed piece, and this time, showing that I am fair and balanced, it’s not positive about Barack Obama and contains some useful insights 🙂
**“They are all now busy planning and strategizing his congressional address on health care [Pito: which will happen later this week]. It will be hard to pull off well. The president will be talking, essentially, to three groups: the political elites of both parties and the media, his supporters on the ground, and highly informed citizens who are already either for or against the plan but want to hear, ponder and form an opinion on the speech.” (from** [Peggy Noonan](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204731804574391153099885242.html))
