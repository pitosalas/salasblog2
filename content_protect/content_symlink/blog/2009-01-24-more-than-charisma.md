From [Bob Herbert, in today’s New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/opinion/24herbert.html?_r=1&scp=2&sq=clownish&st=cse):
> “… [we’ve witnessed] the almost desperate hunger in this country for mature leadership, for someone who is not recless and clownish, shortsighted and self-absorbed.” (**from** [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/opinion/24herbert.html?_r=1&scp=2&sq=clownish&st=cse))

Someone asked said to me the other day, ‘you’re really political aren’t you?’ I don’t consider myself very political at all, never have been. One a scale of 1 to 10, I’d rate myself a 3. So in a way I have surprised myself in the last 12 months.

I have to say that when I read it, the thought expressed in the quote above really resonated.
