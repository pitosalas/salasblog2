This just struck me as curious:[ “Letters to God end up in ocean, unread”](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061103/ap_on_re_us/unanswered_prayers_7)
> “The letters â_” about 300 in all, sent to a New Jersey minister â_” ended up dumped in the ocean, most of them unopened.” (from [AP](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061103/ap_on_re_us/unanswered_prayers_7))
