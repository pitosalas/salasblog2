The true story comes out about the most excellent subservient chicken gimick. [I mentioned it ](/weblogs/archives/000385.html)a few days ago when I first saw it; it was amazing how quickly it spread. [Here is an article ](http://www.adweek.com/aw/creative/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000486708)giving some background on how it was done, where it came from and what the thinking was: “In fact, CP+B came up with about 400 different actions that the chicken could do, and then filmed them in the course of a day in Los Angeles.”
