I don’t know if you followed the spat a few months ago. This [book, “A million little pieces” by James Frey](http://www.amazon.com/Million-Little-Pieces-James-Frey/dp/0307276902) was chosen by Ms. “O” (Oprah) for her book club. A lot of fanfare, a lot of press. It’s a memoir about one man’s experiences as a totally out of control addict, then joining a rehab program and getting on the road to recovery. 

The problem is / was that after Oprah made all this fuss about James Frey, it [turned out that certain details of the book were fictionalized](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0104061jamesfrey1.html). It was not exactly clear whether 10%, 20% or what were not from his real life experience. But [Oprah](http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/books/01/11/frey.lkl/) threw a fit in a famous ‘[come to Oprah](http://www2.oprah.com/tows/pastshows/200601/tows_past_20060126.jhtml)‘ episode where she publicly berated and humiliated James Frey for misleading Her and making her stake her reputation on a true life story which turned out not to be 100% true. It was good TV, but an unpleasant affair to watch. Even [Wikipedia got into the act!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Million_Little_Pieces)

Well I finally got around to reading this book. It is excellent, outstanding, informative, dramatic, well written and compelling. Frankly it matters not a wit whether it’s 100% true or not. It was instructive to actually read the object of Oprah’s wrath because from hearing and reading **about it**, you’d easily bypass the book and not read it. I really **recommend it!
